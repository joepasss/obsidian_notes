### Identifying Device Model Numbers and Serial Numbers

You can identify the model and serial number of your Cisco device by looking at the stickers typically located on the back of the device chassis (though they are sometimes displayed on the front).

> PID: WS-C3750G-224TS-S
> SN: FDO1125Z6VQ

You can use other methods to identify the type of Cisco hardware you are working with. A Cisco router or switch device usually includes other markings, such as a logo displaying the device model number. You may also find markings that identify the model of the following devices:

* Adapters
	* These are network interface cards added to the Cisco device.
* Modules
	* Many different types of modules can be added to a slot on a Cisco device.
	* A common example of a module is a WAN interface card (WIC) used to install a T1 interface or serial port to the router.
* Line card
	* This is a circuit board that provides LAN or WAN ports to high-end routers that are designed to accept line cards.

Each of these devices may have markings that indicate the type of device or the model of the device. For example, if you look at the metal plate on WIC module device, you will see the module type, such as WIC1DSU/T1, which is a T1 WAN interface card.

You can also find the model number and serial number of your Cisco device by using the `show version` command. Looking at the following code example:
![[Pasted image 20250428203630.png]]

> Cisco 1900 series device
> Cisco 1921 router
> two Gigabit interfaces

`show version` command also shows the serial number of the device in the "Processor board ID" field. shows what interfaces exist in the device.

### Types of Software

Each Cisco device is powered by a Cisco operating system that is responsible for providing the features of that device.

* Cisco IOS
	* The Cisco Internetwork Operating System (IOS)
	* The IOS provides the networking functions, protocols, and security features of the device.
	* runs directly on the hardware of the Cisco device.
* Cisco IOS XE
	* originally released with the ASR 1000 and Catalyst 3850 Series routers.
	* It differes from the IOS in that IOS XE is a Linux kernel that runs a version of the IOS on top of the kernel (which is why your IOS commands work with IOS XE).
	* By running a Linux kernel as the foundation of the OS, you can run different applications on the device.
* Cisco IOS XR
	* This Unix-based OS is totally different from the Cisco IOS, but it uses many commands similar to those used on the Cisco IOS.
	* however, that all IOS commands may not neccessarily work on the IOS XR.
	* This OS is geared toward service providers and is used with devices such as Cisco XR 120000 Series routers.
* Cisco NX-OS
	* for Cisco Nexus series switches
	* built on a Linux kernel and supports Phython as a scripting language for automating changes to the device.
	* Although it is different from the Cisco IOS, the commands used are very similar, which makes it easy for a technician to adapt to NX-OS.

### Licensing Process

When you purchase your Cisco device, you must purchase licenses for the device, and if you replace a device with a newer device, you will need to obtain licenses for the new device.

### Bundle Mode and Install Mode

Cisco IOS XE switches, such as the 3850 and the 3650, support two operation modes: bundle mode and install mode. With bundle mode, the Cisco OS is stored as an image file in flash memory. The device loads that image into memory on bootup. Install mode is the default mode used on swithes and includes the provisioning file packages.conf to boot the Cisco switch. The switch also contains a number of .pkg files in flash memory that are referenced by the packages.conf file. Install mode is most beneficial if you are using a large number of switches, because you can perform an upgrade on all the switches without needing to copy an image file.

### Questions

The following questions will help you measure your understanding of the
material presented in this chapter. Read all the choices carefully because
there may be more than one correct answer. Choose the correct answer(s)
for each question.
1.  What type of memory on the Cisco devices stores the POST routines?
A. NVRAM
B. VRAM
C. Flash
D. ROM

POST(Power-On Self-Test) routine, 장비가 켜질 때 하드웨어 체크, ROM에 저장됨

NVRAM = 설정파일 저장
Flash = IOS 운영체제 적재
VRAM = 비디오 메모리

2.  You are reviewing the ports on a router with your customer, who
asks what is the purpose of the AUX port. How would you respond?
A. It’s used to telnet into the router.
B. It’s used to connect a modem to the router.
C. It’s used to SSH into the router.
D. It’s used as an additional Ethernet connection.

B

AUX 포트에 아날로그 모뎀을 연결해서 원격 관리할 수 있도록 함.
Telnet, SSH = 네트워크 위로 접속, AUX = 모뎀용

3.  You are administering a switch for a customer and need to reference
the third Gigabit Ethernet port on the switch. What label identifier is
used to reference the port?
A. Eth1/3
B. FE1/3
C. Gig1/3
D. Ethernet1/3

Gigabit Ethernet = `Gig`
Fast Ethernet = `FE`
Ethernet = 10Mpbs 인터넷

=> C

4.  Where is the startup configuration file stored on the Cisco device?
A. ROM
B. VRAM
C. NVRAM
D. Flash

NVRAM

5.  Your router has two serial ports used to connect to the WAN. You are
connecting the external CSU/DSU to the second serial port. What is
the label identifier to reference that port?
A. S0/1
B. S0/0
C. G0/0
D. G0/1

S = Serial
G = Gigabit Ethernet

S<slot>/<port>
두 번째 시리얼 = 1 (0부터 시작)

= S0/1

6.  You need to make some changes to a customer’s switch
configuration. You have connected the console cable to the console
port on the switch and the serial port on your laptop. What program
would you use to administer the device? (Choose two.)
A. Notepad
B. PuTTY
C. Ping
D. Tracert
E. Tera Term

B, E

7.  You have made a number of configuration changes to the Cisco

A. ipconfig
B. ping
C. arp
D. netstat
