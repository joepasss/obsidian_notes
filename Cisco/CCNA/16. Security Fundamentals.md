## Understanding Threats and Attack Types

### Fundamentals of Security

#### Confidentiality

The first goal of information security is to keep information confidential, which means not allowing unauthorized individuals to access the information.

**methods to maintain confidentiality**
* You can configure permissions on files and/or folders to block unauthorized individuals from accessing these files and/or folders.
* You can encrypt the data in storage so that they only people with the decryption key can gain access to the data. (known as *encrypt-in-storage*)
* You can encrypt the data as it travels across the network or Internet. (known as *encrypt-in-transit*).

#### Integrity

Integrity deals with being to ensure the integrity of the data that is being read. If, for example, an employee stores a file on the server and the next month access that file, how does show know that the file has not been tampered with or altered?
You can use technologies that offer integrity services to identify whether the file has been altered.

A common technique to prove the integrity is *hashing*.
With hashing, the data (in this case, a file) is run through a hashing algorithm to generate an answer (known as a hash value).
This hash value is then stored for reference at a later time. The next time you read the file, you run the file through the same hashing algorithm to generate a new hash value. You then compare the two hash values: if the two has values are the same, the file has not been altered.

Common examples of hashing algorithms are Message Digest 5 (MD5) and Secure Hashing Algorithm 1 (SHA-1) and 256 (SHA-256).

#### Availability

The third goal of information security is availability. If an employee stores a report on the server, for example, he expects the report to be there later when he needs it.
We can use a number of technologies to increase the chances that a company asset, such as that report, is available

* **Backups**
	* If we make backups of the file server and the server crashes, we can restore the company data from the backups.
* **RAID**
	* Servers have multiple drive configured in a RAID array, so that if a drive fails, employees will still be able to access the company data.
* **Clustering**
	* Servers are places in a highly available cluster, so that if one server fails, the other server can handle the workload.
* **FHRP**
	* You con configure your Cisco router in a first hop redundancy protocol (FHRP) topology, so the if a router fails, another router can take over and employees can still gain Internet or WAN access.

### Vulnerabilities and Exploits

* **Threat**
	* An action that exposes a compromise to confidentiality, integrity, or the availability of an asset.
	* Example threats include denial-of-service (DoS) attacks (which violate availability) or an attacker hacking a database and retrieving credit card number (which violates confidentially).
* **Threat actor**
	* The person or group causing the threat to occur.
	* Common examples are hackers and disgruntled employees.
* **Vulnerability**
	* A weakness in a product that could enable someone to bypass the security of the product and gain access to or cause damage to the system.
	* Every product has vulnerabilities, which is why we need to patch systems regularly.
	* As the product vendor learns of a vulnerability, it ships out the fix in a software patch
* **Exploit**
	* An activity that takes advantage of a system or a software vulnerability to compromise security.
	* Individuals take advantage of system or software vulnerabilities in order to compromise security, leading to an exploit.
* **Mitigation technique**
	* The method used to reduce the likelihood or impact of a threat or to remove it entirely.
	* For example, to mitigate a Dos attack, we could create multiple servers in highly available solution.
	* Or to mitigate a potential attacker's access to credit card numbers, we could encrypt the credit card numbers included in the database.

### Common Vulnerabilities

A number of common configuration mistakes can lead to vulnerabilities on your systems and devices.

**common vulnerabilities**
* **Unnecessary running services**
	* Be sure to assess the service running on a computer and then disable any unnecessary ones.
	* The more software running on a system, the more likely vulnerabilities exist that the hacker can use to gain access to it.
* **Open ports**
	* A Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) or User Datagram Protocol (UDP) port open on the system is an invitation for a hacker to gain access to the system.
	* Close any open ports on the system that are not needed, and use a firewall to block access to ports that must remain open.
* **Unpatched systems**
	* Be sure to keep your systems up-to-date with patches and security fixes.
	* That way, any software on the system is less likely to have vulnerabilities that a hacker can exploit
* **Unencrypted channels**
	* Ensure that any communication channels between systems are encrypted as much as possible.
	* Using unencrypted communication enables hackers to capture the traffic and read the information.
* **Clear-text credentials**
	* Ensure that any communication protocols being used are encrypting the password when users are authenticating to the systems.
	* Replace any unsecure authentication protocols with a secure authentication protocol
* **Unsecure protocols**
	* Be sure to encrypt all communication.
	* Most Internet protocols are daily, such as telnet, HTTP, File Transfer Protocol (FTP), Trivial File Transfer Protocol (TFTP), and Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMPv1 and SNMPv2), send traffic in an unencrypted format.
	* If an attacker captures unencrypted traffic using a sniffer program, he can view the details of the traffic, access any sensitive information in that traffic, and potentially learn the username and password being used to authenticate to the system.
	* Be sure to investigate each protocol used on the network; if it is not encrypting communication, find a secure replacement for the protocol. For example, instead of using telnet for remote administration of your Cisco device, use Secure Shell (SSH).

### Malicious Software

Another common form of hacker attack is through malicious software.

Malicious software is any software that is designed to harm a system, and it comes in many forms.

* **Virus**
	* The traditional virus is attached to a file, so that when you open the file, the virus is activated and infects your system.
	* Viruses can delete files from the system or modify the boot sector so that the computer no longer boots.
* **Warm virus**
	* Today, we usually deal with worm viruses
	* A warm virus is a self-replicating virus, which means that it can infect your system without you opening a file.
	* Warms can arrive as attachments in e-mails, instant messages, or through software vulnerabilities.
	* Or it may be present on a flash drive that infects your system when you connect the flash drive to your computer.
	* A worm virus infects one computer and then spreads across your entire network.
* **Trojan virus**
	* A Trojan virus is a program that you are tricked into installing because you believe the application does something useful; in reality, however, the program is a virus that infects your system.
	* The Trojan virus typically modifies your system by opening a TCP/IP port, which allows a hacker to connect to the system and take control of it.
* **Spyware**
	* This hidden software monitors and collects information about you and your internet surfing habits.
	* Spyware has also been known to do more than just monitor for information: it can make changes to your system through browser redirection (sending you to a different web page) or slow down your network connection.
* **Adware**
	* This software automatically loads advertisements on your screen, typically in the form of pop-up windows.
	* The advertisements are designed to entice you into purchasing products or subscribing to particular web sites.
* **Logic bomb**
	* This type of virus is planted on your system with the intention of infecting it later.
	* After an infected application is installed, the logic bomb waits until a particular condition is satisfied, such as a specific date, and then the virus performs its malicious purpose.
* **Keylogger**
	* A Keylogger is either a piece of software or a hardware device installed on your system that is designed to capture all of your keystrokes in an attempt to learn your passwords and other information.
* **Spam**
	* Spam refers to unsolicited commercial e-mails.
	* These e-mail messages typically are mass mailed, and their purpose is to convince you to purchase their products or services.
	* The spammers (people who send the spam messages) usually get your e-mail address from a web site or newsgroup after you have posted a comment to the group.
* **Ransomware**
	* This malicious software takes control of your system and does not give control back until you pay a fee.
	* In a recent common scenario, ransomware encrypts your drive, and you must pay a fee to get the encryption key.

### Mitigating Attacks

common mitigation techniques that can help you prevent attacks of reduce the impacts of attacks:

* **Patch systems**
	* The first step you can take to protect your systems is to ensure that you have a patch management strategy in place.
	* Make sure that you keep all systems up-to-date with patches, because they remove known vulnerabilities from your system.
	* Most operating systems and applications have an automatic update feature that you can enable so that updates are downloaded and applied automatically as they are released.
* **Encrypt network traffic**
	* To protect your data from prying eyes, ensure that you are encrypting all network communication.
	* This include encrypting web, e-mail, and FTP traffic, if need be.
* **Encrypt data stored on mobile devices**
	* Ensure that you are encrypting data that is stored on laptops and other mobile devices.
	* Employees may lose their devices, or their mobile devices may be stolen at some point, so it is critical that data stored on these devices is encrypted and that the devices are password protected.
* **Use strong passwords**
	* Ensure that you are using strong passwords for all user accounts and devices.
* **Run hashing algorithms**
	* You can verify the integrity of data by running it through a mathematical hashing algorithm, which generates a hash value.
	* The server uses a key to create a hash value with a password stored on the server and then compares the resulting value with the hash value sent by the client. If the two hash values are the same, the client has supplied the correct password. If the has values are different, this indicates that the data has been changed in some way.
	* Examples of hashing algorithms are MD5 and SHA

### Attack Types

#### Social Engineering Attacks

With a social engineering attack, the attacker compromises the network or system through social interaction with an individual through an e-mail message or phone call, tricking the victim into divulging information that can be used to compromise security.

The information the victim divulges to hacker would most likely be used in a subsequent attack to gain unauthorized access to a system or network.

Education is the key to protecting yourself and fellow employees from social engineering attacks. Keeping all personal aware of the popularity of social engineering attacks and the different scenarios that could be examples of such attacks will help raise the security level of the organization.

**Common social engineering attack**

* **Attacker impersonates administrator**
	* the attacker may call an employee and impersonate the company's network administartor.
	* The hacker will try to convince the employee to change his or her password or divulge password information so that the attacker can use the information to access the system.
* **Attacker impersonates user**
	* The attacker calls an unsuspecting network administrator and plays the role of a frustrated user who cannot log on to the network.
	* The network administrator naturally helps the "user" by resetting his or her password and helping the person log on, which result in giving the attacker access to the system.
* **Attacker impersonates vendor**
	* The attacker may e-mail a customer and pretend to be a vendor of a piece of software.
	* The attacker tries to convince the user to install an update, but the user doesn't realize the update is actually a Trojan virus that gives the attacker access to the system.

#### Phishing Attack

A common type of social engineering attack in use these days, a phishing attack occurs when the hacker creates a fake web site looks exactly like a popular web site.

The attacker sends on e-mail message trying to trick the user into clicking a link that leads to the fake site (called "phishing").
When the user attempts to log on to the fake site with his or her account information, the attacker records the username and password and then tries using that information to log on to the real site, potentially gaining access to the user's account.

There are several forms of phishing attacks.
*Spear phishing* is focused on a specific victim or group of victims. In general, phishing attacks are sent to random e-mail addresses, but in spear phishing, the attacker poses as a known or trusted sender and targets specific individuals or groups.

*whaling attack* is form of phishing attack that is targeted at company executives, such as a CEO.

#### Network-Based Attacks

Most types of attacks are considered network-based attacks, in which the hacker performs the attack from a remote system.

* **Eavesdropping attack**
	* Also known as *packet sniffing*
	* eavesdropping involves the use of a network monitoring tool known as a sniffer, which is used to capture and analyze network traffic.
	* If the traffic is not encrypted, the hacker could read confidential data, including usernames and passwords.
* **Spoofing**
	* In a spoof attack, the hacker modifies the source address of the packets he or she is sending so that the packet appears to be coming from someone else.
	* Spoofing is common method to bypass access controls placed on switches, routers, or firewalls.
	* *different types of spoofing*
		* *MAC spoofing*
			* involves altering the source MAC address of a packet.
			* It is common for an attacker to spoof the MAC address so that he can bypass the MAC filtering features on a wireless network or attempt to bypass the port security features of a switch
		* *IP spoofing*
			* involves altering the source IP address of a packet.
			* An attacker may use IP spoofing to attempt to bypass access control lists (ACLs) on a router or firewall.
		* *E-mail spoofing*
			* involves altering the source e-mail address of an e-mail message.
			* E-mail spoofing is typically used by an attacker in a phishing attack to make e-mail look like it is coming from someone else (a trusted party).
* **Man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack**
	* With an MITM attack, the hacker inserts himself in the middle of two systems that are communicating.
	* He then passes the information back and forth between the two, with neither party knowing all the communication is passing through the hacker's system.
	* The benefit of this is the hacker can then view an sensitive data sent between the two systems.
* **Hijack attack**
	* A hacker takes over a session between you and another individual and disconnects the other individual from the communication. You still believe that you are talking to the original party and send private information to the hacker instead of the original party.
* **Denial of service**
	* A denial-of-service (DoS) attacker causes the system or its service to either crash or become unresponsive. As a result, the system cannot fulfill its purpose and provide those services.
	* For example, your web server that it becomes overwhelmed too busy to service valid request from your customers.
* **Distributed denial of service**
	* With a DDoS, the hacker uses multiple systems to attack a single target system.
	* A good example is the smurf attack, in which the hacker pings a number of computers but modifies the source address of those packets so that they appear to come from another system (the victim, in this case).
	* When all of these systems receive the ping request, they will reply to the same address, essentially overburdening that system with data.
* **Buffer overflow**
	* In a buffer overflow attack, the attacker sends more data to a buffer than it can hold.
	* The data may include malicious code that may corrupt data or cause private information to be revealed, providing the attacker the ability to gain administrative access to the system in a command prompt or shell.
* **Exploit attack**
	* In this type of attack, the attacker knows of a security problem (a vulnerability) within an operating system or a piece of software and leverages that knowledge by exploiting the vulnerability.
* **Botnet**
	* A botnet is a group of systems that a hacker takes over and uses in a DDoS attack.
* **DNS poisoning**
	* With DNS poisoning, a hacker alters (or poisons) your DNS data in order to redirect clients to the wrong system.
	* In another common attack against DNS, a hacker tries to do a zone transfer (copy your DNS data) in order to map out your network.
* **Smurf attack**
	* In a smurf attack, the hacker sends a ping message to a number of systems but spoofs the IP address so that it looks like the ping messages are coming from different systems.
	* The result is that all the systems send ping replies to the victim, essentially performing a DDoS.
* **Friendly/unintentional DoS
	* Some scenarios can lead to an unintentional DoS attack.
	* For example, an account lockout policy could lead to a DoS, preventing the user from logging on once the account is locked.
	* User may also unintentionally cause a DoS if they delete a file by accident.
* **Physical attack**
	* Physical attacks occur when the attacker gains physical access to your facility and is able to cause damage to your equipment or even the facility.
	* Implementing physical security controls, such as locking mechanisms and guards, can help prevent these attacks.
* **ARP poisoning**
	* A hacker can insert herself in the middle of communication by altering the Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) cache on a victim's system and causing all communication to pass through the hacker's system, enabling her to capture all traffic.
	* This is a common method to perform an MITM attack.
* **VLAN hopping**
	* VLAN hopping is an exploit against virtual local area networks (VLANs) that enables an individual to gain access to a VLAN when he is not connected to it.
	* Hackers accomplish this by double-tagging the frames for different VLANs, or they can imitate a trunking port so that they receive all traffic.
* **Deauthentication**
	* A deauthentication attack is common in wireless attacks.
	* The hacker sends a command to disconnect or deauthenticate the client from the wireless network. As a result, the client is forced to reauthenticate with the wireless network where hacker can capture the reauthentication traffic.
	* The authentication packets can be replayed by the attacker in order to generate more traffic in hops of cracking the wireless encryption.
* **Zero-day attacks**
	* In a zero-day attack, a vulnerability unknown by the software developer is exploited before the developer realizes the problem and issues a patch.
	* Companies can have a team in place to test software and identify vulnerabilities not yet known.

#### Password Attacks

An attacker may try to crack the passwords stored in a network account database or a password-protected file.

* **Dictionary attack**
	* This attack involves the use of a word list file, which is a list of potential passwords.
	* The attacker uses a program to read any try each of the passwords from the file to break into a system.
	* This is a very quick form of password attack, because no calculations are required: the attacker is simply reading a file
* **Brute-force attack**
	* The attacker uses a program that tries every possible combination of characters to guess a password.
	* This attack is slower than a dictionary attack because a file is not read; instead, the program calculates each possible password.
* **Hybrid attack**
	* Like a dictionary attack, a hybrid attack involves a word list file, but it also places numbers at the end of the words to catch passwords that are not dictionary words, in cast a password contains a number at the end, which is common.
