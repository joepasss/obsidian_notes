## Configuring TCP/IP

To configure TCP/IP properly, must know the settings for the IP address, subnet mask, and default gateway

### IP Address

The IP address is a 32-bit value that uniquely identifies the system on the network (or the internet).

Each of the 8-bit values is called an octet. There are four octet in an IP address (192.168.1.15). The four octets in an IP address are divided into two parts: a network ID and a host ID.
* network ID
	* is a unique number that identifies the particular network,
* host ID
	* unique number that identifies the computer or device on that network.

The subnet mask determines the number of bits that make up the network ID and the number of bits that make up the host ID.

### Subnet Mask

The subnet mask is used by TCP/IP to determine whether a host is on a local or remote network. When a 255 is used in an octet, then the corresponding octet in the IP address represents the network ID So, if my IP address is 192.168.1.15 and my subnet mask is 255.255.255.0, the first octets of the subnet mask would represent the network ID (192.168.1.15) and the last octet (0) would represent the host ID (15)

서브넷 마스크가 255.255.255.0 이라고 가정하면, 255인 부분은 네트워크 ID, 0인 부분은 호스트 ID 그래서 같은 네트워크에 있는지 아닌지를 비교하려면 네트워크 부분 (여기서는 1, 2, 3번째 옥텟) 을 비교해서 (0인부분은 호스트 ID라서 비교 안함) 같은 네트워크에 있는지 다른 네트워크에 있는지 판단 가능함

**N = 네트워크 ID, H = 호스트 ID**
![[스크린샷 2025-04-23 01.21.09.png]]

why do we have a subnet mask that breaks the IP address into a network ID and a host ID?

When a system such as 192.168.45.10, with a subnet mask of 255.255.255.0 sends a piece of data to system 192.168.45.10 the sending system first needs to determine whether the target computer exists on the same network or not. it does tis by comparing the network IDs if the network IDs are the same, then both systems exist on the same network and one system can send to other without the use of a router. if the systems exist on different networks, the data will need to passed to the router the router can send the data to the other network.

**192.168.45.10 w/ subnet mask 255.255.255.0 -> 192.168.45.10**

전달 시스템이 가장 먼저 확인해야하는거는 source 와 dest 가 같은 네트워크에 있는지 다른 네트워크에 있는지 확인해야함
1. if the systems exist on different networks
	* send to router
2. if both system exist on the same network
	* send to switch (without using router)

이때 subnet mask를 이용해서 확인 가능함

### Default Gateway

When your system wants to send data to another system on the network, it looks at its own network ID and compares that to the destination system's network ID. If if appears that both have the same network ID, the data is sent directly from your system to the destination system. If the two systems are on different networks, your system must pass the data to the router so that the router can send the data to the destination system's router. How does your system know where the router is? The default gateway is the IP address of the router that will be used to send data from your network to another network.

시스템이 다른 네트워크로 데이터를 전송하고 싶어함,
1. if own network Id and destination system's network ID is same
	* sent directly from system to destination system
2. if two system are on different network,
	* 시스템이 라우터로 데이터 전송함.
	* 라우터에서 dest router 로 데이터 전송
	* 여기서, source system 이 dest router 가 어디에 있는지 알려고 한다면, "the default gateway" 를 이용함

### Address Classes

Every IP address belongs to a distinct address class. The Internet community defined these classes to accommodate networks of various sizes. The class to which the IP address belongs initially determines the network ID and host ID portions of the address, along with the number of hosts that are supported on that network. The different class addresses are class A, class B, class C, class D, and class E.

![[스크린샷 2025-04-23 02.42.11.png]]

### Class A Addresses

**First Octet**: `1-127, 00000001-01111111`
**subnet mask**: `255.0.0.0`
**Hosts per network**: 256 x 256 x 256 = 16777216, (two addresses on each IP network you are not allowed to assign to systems because they are reserved)
**reserved network**: n.0.0.0(represent network itself) or n.255.255.255 (broadcast address)

### Class B Addresses

**First Octet**: `128-191, 10000000-10111111`
**subnet mask**: `255.255.0.0`
**Hosts per network**: 256 x 256 = 65536, 65532 (remove reserved network)

### Class C Addresses

**First Octet**: `192-223, 11000000-11011111`
**subnet mask**: `255.255.255.0`
**Hosts per network**: 256, 254 (remove reserved network)

## Class D Addresses

Class D addresses are used for special types of applications on the network `multicasting applications`. Because class D addresses are used for multicast addresses, you will not be assigning them specifically to hosts on the network for normal network communication

**First Octet**: `224-239, 11100000-11101111`

class D has the potential for 268,435,456 unique multicast groups that users can subscribe to from a multicast application

### Class E Addresses

they were designed for experimental purposes only,

**First Octet**: `240-247, 11110000-11110111`

1. class a, subnet mask: 255.0.0.0
2. class c, subnet mask: 255.255.255.0
3. class b, subnet mask: 255.255.0.0
4. class a, subnet mask: 255.0.0.0
5. class b, subnet mask: 255.255.0.0
6. class a, subnet mask: 255.0.0.0
7. class a, subnet mask: 255.0.0.0

> class A 00000001-01111111
> class B 10000000-10111111
> class C 11000000-11011111
> class D 11100000-11101111
> class E 11110000-11110111

---

### Loopback Address

not allowed to have a host assigned an IP address that has a value of 127 in the first octet. This is because the class A address range of 127 has been reserved for the loopback address.

The loopback address is used to refer to the local system, also known as the localhost. (127.0.0.1)

> `ping 127.0.0.1` `ping localhost` `ping loopback` 등으로 확인 가능

### Private Addresses

A private address can be assigned to a system but cannot be used for any kind of internet connectivity. Private addresses are nonroutable on the internet,

Three address ranges are private:
* 10.0.0.0-10.255.255.255
* 172.16.0.0-172.31.255.255
* 192.168.0.0-192.168.255.255

we use a Network Address Translation (NAT) device to translate the private address to a public address.

### APIPA (Automatic Private IP Addressing)

When a client boots up and cannot contact a DHCP server, the client will configure itself automatically with a 169.254.x.y address. if there is something wrong with the DHCP server and none of the systems on the network can obtain an address, all of the clients will assign themselves an address within the 169.254 address range and will then be able to communicate with one another (they all on the same network)

APIPA does not assign a default gateway, so you will be unable to access resources on a remote network and the internet but you can still communicate with systems on your network.

> Cannot find DHCP Server -> 169.254.x.y

### Invalid IP Addresses for Hosts

A few IP addresses cannot be assigned to hosts on the network. You may wonder, for example, why a class C address can have only 254 hosts and not 256, as would seem more likely, since an 8-bit number can have 256 possible values.

The reason for this seeming discrepancy is that two of the addresses are lost from the available host pool. The first is an address that has all bits set to 0s in the host ID, which signifies the network ID of the network. The second is an address that has all bits set to 1s in the host ID, which signifies the broadcast address for the network.

* network ID
	* HOST ID가 전부 0으로 set 되어 있음
* Broadcast Address
	* HOST ID가 전부 1으로 set 되어 있음

Another illegal address is any system that has the first octet of 127; (loopback address)

**illegal addresses**

* Any address starting with 127 (loopback)
* All host bits set to 0 (Network ID)
* All host bits set to 1 (Broadcast Address)
* A duplicate address

### Exercise 4-5: Understanding Valid Addresses

![[스크린샷 2025-04-23 06.06.20.png]]

1. valid
	* 10.0.0.0: network ID
	* 10.255.255.255: broadcast
2. invalid, loopback address
3. valid
	* 131.107.0.0: network ID
	* 131.107.255.255: broadcast
4. valid
	* 45.0.0.0: network ID
	* 45.255.255.255: broadcast
5. invalid, broadcast
6. invalid, value is 0 to 255
	* 63.0.0.0: network ID
	* 63.255.255.255: broadcast
7. invalid, network ID
	* 200.67.34.0: network ID
	* 200.67.34.255: broadcast
8. valid
	* 131.107.0.0: network ID
	* 131.107.255.255: broadcast

---

### Addressing Schemes

On a network, data can be sent to the destination in several different ways: data can be sent to a unicast address, a broadcast address, or a multicast address.

* **Unicast**
	* Sends information to one system. With IP
	* sending data to the IP address of the intended destination system.
* **Broadcast**
	* Sends information to all systems on the network.
	* using the broadcast address for the network
* **Multicast**
	* Sends information to a selected group of systems.
	* accomplished by having the systems subscribe to a multicast address
	* Most multicast addresses start with 224.x.y.z and are considered class D addresses

### TCP/IP Ports

An application or process uses a TCP/IP port as an identifier for that application/process running on a system.

![[스크린샷 2025-04-23 06.20.51.png]]

Server applications typically use low port numbers under 1024, whereas client applications usually run on port numbers greater than 1024.

* **Well-known ports**
	* These port numbers are used by servers and range from 0 to 1023.
* **Registered Ports**
	* These ports are assigned to certain applications or protocols.
	* 1024-49151
* **Dynamic Ports**
	* used by applications temporarily
	* 49152-65535

![[스크린샷 2025-04-23 06.24.59.png]]

**socket**
which is the endpoint of communication and is made up of three components:
1. IP address of the system
2. port number of application
3. protocol that is being used

`Socket = IP address + Port number + Protocol (TCP or UDP)`

## Configuring IP Address Settings

### Manual Configuration vs. DHCP

When configuring IP address settings on your workstations or network devices such as routers and switches, you can either manually configure the setting or dynamically assign addresses via DHCP.

### Manual Configuration

manually inputting the IP address, subnet mask, and default gateway setting. we normally configure only servers, routers, and switches. The clients on the network obtain their IP address dynamically from the DHCP server

### Dynamic Configuration

Configuring IP addressing on a large TCP/IP-based network can be a nightmare, especially if machines are moved frequently from one network to another.

DHCP can help with the workload of configuring systems on a network by assigning addresses to systems automatically on bootup.

The process of dynamically assigning IP address is managed via a DHCP server. The DHCP server can be a separate device, a service running on a server, or a service loaded on your rotuer.

When a PC powers on and is configured to use DHCP server,
1. DHCP Discover
	* The client sends out a DHCP Discover message, which is a broadcast request packet, looking for any DHCP services on the network.
2. DHCP Offer
	* The DHCP server responds with a DHCP Offer message containing an IP address that the client can lease.
3. DHCP Request
	* The client then accepts the offer by sending a DHCP Request message to the DHCP server for that address
4. DHCP Acknowledgment
	* The DHCP server responds by sending a DHCP ACK message to the client confirming the client is leasing the address.
	* The DHCP ACK message also contains additional TCP/IP settings such as the lease time.
	* The DHCP server marks the IP address in its database as being in use so that it is not assigned again.

### Linux

There are a few different ways you can use to modify your IP address on Linux systems depending on the distribution.

```shell
# ifconfig
ifconfig eth0 12.0.0.11 netmask 255.0.0.0

# eth card, with 12.0.0.11 IP, with 255.0.0.0 subnet mask

### verify IP address Settings
ifconfig
```

## Understanding the Pathway of Communication

![[스크린샷 2025-04-24 15.41.07.png]]

**COMPUTER B -> COMPUTER D**
1. `ping 13.0.0.10`
2. Computer B compares its Ip address and subnet mask
	* I: 12.0.0.10
	* S: 255.0.0.0
	* => Computer B and Computer D is located in different network
3. Computer B retrieves the default gateway (12.0.0.1) setting from the TCP/IP settings, as that is the address it needs to send the data to in order to send data to a different network.
4. Computer B then ARPs the IP address of the default gateway to obtain the MAC address of the default gateway.
5. The ARP reply message is returned to Computer B with the MAC address of the default gateway.
6. Computer B sends the data to the router with:
	* Layer 2 Header:
		* Source MAC: 2222.2222.2222
		* DEST MAC  : AAAA.5555.5555
	* Layer 3 Header:
		* Source IP: 12.0.0.10
		* Dest IP  : 13.0.0.10
7. The router receives the layer 2 frame and then reads the layer 3 header to determine where the packet is headed.
	* The router sees that the packet is destined for 13.0.0.10 => checks routing table. if it exists, it just send data
8. To send the data, the router needs to know the MAC address of 13.0.0.10, so it sends out an ARP request message.
9. The router receives the ARP reply containing the MAC address of Computer D
10. The router sends the data to Computer D with:
	* Layer 2 Header:
		* Source MAC: BBBB.6666.6666
		* DEST MAC  : 4444.4444.4444
	* Layer 3 Header
		* Source IP: 12.0.0.10
		* DEST IP  : 13.0.0.10

Layer 2 header is modified each step, but the layer 3 header is never modified
