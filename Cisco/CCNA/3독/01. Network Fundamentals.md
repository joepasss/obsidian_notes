## Introduction to Networks

A *network* includes all of the components (hardware and software) involved in connecting computers and applications across small and large distances.

### Network Characteristics

* **Cost**
	* Includes the cost of the network components, their installation, and their ongoing maintenance.
* **Security**
	* Includes the protection of the network components and the data they contain and/or the data transmitted between them.
* **Speed**
	* Includes how fast data is transmitted between network endpoints (the data rate).
* **Topology**
	* Describes the physical cabling layout and the logical way data moves between components.
* **Scalability**
	* Defines how well the network can adapt to new groth, including new users, applications, and network components.
* **Reliability**
	* Defines the ability of network components to provide the appropriate levels of support and the required connectivity levels.
	* The *mean time between failures (MTBF)* is a measurement commonly used to indicate the likelihood of a component failing.
* **Availability**
	* Measures the likelihood of the network being available to the users, where downtime occurs when the network is not available because of an outage or scheduled maintenance.
	* Typically measured in a percentage based on the number of minutes that exist in a yer. Therefore *uptime* would be the number of minutes the network is available divided by the number of minutes in a year.

### Networking Components

*Applications*, the software that enables users to perform various tasks, make up a key component of networking.
Many applications are *network-aware*, which means they enable you to access and use resources that are not stored directly on your local computer.

*Protocols* are used to enable systems to talk to one another on the network.

**common Internet protocols**

* **Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP)**
	* sending e-mail
* **Post Office Protocol 3 (POP3)**
	* downloading e-mail from an e-mail server to your system so that you can read e-mail.
* **Internet Message Access Protocol version 4 (IMAP4)**
	* Used to read e-mail.
	* IMAP4 supports additional capabilities and folder support over POP3.
* **File Transfer Protocol (FTP)**
	* Transferring files across the Internet.
* **Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP)**
	* Deliver web pages from a web server to a web browser.

Some applications require little bandwidth, while other requires a lot. Some applications operate in real-time, some operate interactively.
Today's networks need to accommodate all these different types of resouces and applications, including their specific requirements, such as bandwidth. *Quality of service (OoS)* features are commonly used to meet these requirements.

To build a network, you need three component categories:

* **Networking software**
	* There are two types of software components: server, and client
		* The server software offers some form of service to clients on the network.
		* The client software connects to the servers to request to use the services.
* **Networking hardware**
	* hubs, switchs, routers, firewalls, and etc
	* Responsible for moving information between the LAN and WAN.
* **Media type**
	* Copper cabling, fiber cabling, and wireless.
	* Used to transmit data from one system to another on the network.

### Network Locations

### Local Area Networks

Local area networks (LANs) are used to connect networking devices that reside in a close geographic area.

The media types used in LANs include copper and fiber cabling. They can also include Ethernet, Fast Ethernet, Gigabit Ethernet, Token Ring, and Fiber Distributed Data Interface.

### Wide Area Networks

Wide area networks (WANs) are used to connect multiple LANs together.

Four basic types of connections, or circuits, are used in WAN services: circuit-switched, cell-switched, packet-switched, and dedicated connections.

A wide array of WAN services are available to connect different office locations, including analog dialp, Asynchonous Transfer Mode (ATM), dedicated circuits, cable, digital subscriber line (DSL), Frame Relay, Integrated Services Digital Network (ISDN), and X.25.

*Circuit-switched* services provide a temporary connection across a phone cirtuit.
In networking these services are typically used for backup of primary circuits and for temporary boosts of bandwidth.

A *dedicated circuit* is a permanent connection between two sites in which the bandwidth is dedicated to that company's use.

*Cell-switched* services can provide the same features that dedicated circuits offer, such as having a dedicated link, but one of its advantages over dedicated circuits is that it enables a single device to connect to multiple devices on the same interface.
The downside of these services is that they are not available at all locations, they are difficult to set up and troubleshoot, and the equipement is expensive when compared to equipment used for dedicated circuits.

*Packet-switched* services are similar to cell-switched services, except cell-switched services switch *fixed-length* packets called cells and packet switched services siwtch *variable length* packets.

Two other WAN services that are very popular techonologies for high-speed Internet connections are digital subscriber lines (DSLs) and cable.

DSL provides speeds up to a few megabits per second and cost much less than a typical WAN circuit from the carrier.
The main disadvantage of DSL is that coverage is limited to about 18,000 feet, and the service is not available in all areas.

Cable access uses coaxial copper and fiber connections. Cable supports higher data rates than DSL, but like DSL, it provides a full-time connection.
However, cable has two major drawbacks: it is a shared service and functions in a logical bus topology much like Ethernet, so the more customers in an area that connect via cable, the less bandwidth each customer has; also many people are sharing the medium, it is more susceptible to security risks such as eavesdropping on other subscribers' traffic.

## Common Network Services and Devices

### Types of Services

* **DNS server**
	* This service is responsible for resolving fully qualified domain names (FQDNs) to IP address.
* **DHCP server**
	* This service is responsible for assigning IP address to computers and devices when they connect to the network.
* **HTTP server**
	* This service is responsible for hosting web pages that can be delivered to clients that connect to the web server.
* **File server**
	* This service is used to hold all of the data files for a company.
* **Application server**
	* This server has specified applications installed to provide services on the network.
* **SMTP/POP**
	* This service runs specific protocols that enable e-mail software to send or receive e-mails.
		* SMTP is the Internet protocol for sending e-mail
		* POP is the Internet protocol for reading e-mail
* **FTP**
	* This service can be installed on a host to enable someone to connect to the network and transfer files across the network or Internet.
	* FTP uses TCP and supports authentication.
* **TFTP**
	* The Trivial File Transfer Protocol service enables you to upload or download a file.
	* TFTP uses the UDP and does not support authentication
* **Ping**
	* This is command-line tool that is used to test connectivity with another system.
* **Telnet**
	* This service enables you to create a remote connection to a system.
	* Telnet sends all communication in clear text, including the username and password
* **SSH**
	* Secure Shell is the secure method of performing remote administration of a device on the network.
	* SSH encrypts all communication including the username and password.

### Network Infrastructure Components

#### Hub

A hub is replaced by the more effective and secure switches. On an older network, all systems connected to the hub to provide network communication.

* **No filtering**
	* When a system was to send data to another system, the hub would receive the data and then send the data to all other ports on the hub.
	* It simply received the signal and sent it to all ports.
* **Collisions**
	* Because any data sent was sent to all other ports, and because any system could send its own data at any time, this resulted in a lot of collisions on the network.
	* A collision occurs when two pieces of data collide and then must be retransmitted.
* **Security**
	* Because the data was sent to all ports on the hub, all systems receive *all* data.
	* Systems look at the destination address in the frame to decide whether to process the data or discard it. but if someone was running a packet sniffer on a system that used a hub, he would receive all packets and be able to read them.

#### Layer 2 Switch

The switch tracks every device's MAC address and then associates that device's MAC address with the prot on the switch to which the device is connected. The switch stores this information in a MAC address table in memory on the switch. The switch then acts as a filtering device by sending data only to the port that data is destined for.

#### Router

A router sends, or routes, data from one network to another until the data reaches its final destination. Routers use the IP address to determine what network to send the data to.

The router has a routing table, which is a list of all the networks that it knows how to reach. A router also includes a *gateway of last resorts (GWLR)* setting that is used if the router does not have a route to the desination in its routing table.

![[Pasted image 20251122030322.png]]

If computer A wanted to send data to computer D:

1. The data would leave computer A's network card and go to the switch.
2. The switch would forward the frame to the R1 router.
3. The R1 router would look at the destination address of the data and note that the data is destined for computer D on the 14.0.0.0 network.
4. Router R1 would look at its routing table to determine whether it knows how to send data to the 14.0.0.0 network.
5. The data is then sent to router R2.
6. When router R2 receives the data, it looks at the destination address of the data and determines that it needs to send the data to comptuer D on the LAN.

#### Layer 3 Switch

A layer 3 switch performs all the functions of a layer 2 switch, but it also has the added functionality a *being a router*.

#### Connecting to WAN with CSU/DSU

The *channel service unit/data service unit (CSU/DSU)* is a device that enables an organization to connect a high-speed data link from the ISP to the organization's router for access to and from a LAN or WAN.
These high-speed connections are usually T1 or T3 connections or their European counterparts, E1 and E3. The CSU/DSU used will be specific to the speed of the line being connected to an from the service provider.
The CSU/DSU device handles signaling over the T1/T3 link, sending data between your router and the service provider.

![[Pasted image 20251122031503.png]]

The *demarc*, also known as the *demarcation point*, is the point where the service provider's equipement connects to your building.
The *demarc extension* refers to the area between the connection into your building and your company's communication equipment.

#### Firewalls

Firewalls control which traffic is allowed to enter a network or system and which traffic should be blocked.

* **Packet filtering firewall**
	* Filter traffic based on the source and destination IP addresses, the source and destination port numbers, and the protocol used.
	* It does not understand the context of the conversation, so it is easy for a hacker to craft a packet to pass through the firewall.
* **Stateful packet inspection firewall**
	* Filters traffic based on source and destination IP addresses, the source and destination port numbers, and the protocol in use, but it also understands the context of a conversation and will not allow a packet through the firewall unless it suits a specific scenario.
* **Next-generation firewall (NGFW)**
	* Layer 7 firewall that can inspect the application data and detect malicious packets.

#### Intrusion Prevention System (IPS)

An *intrusion prevention system (IPS)* is a security device that monitors activity, logs any suspicious activity, and then takes some form of corrective action.

For example, if someone is doing a port scan on the network, the IPS would discover this suspicious activity, log the activity, and then disconnect the system that is performing the port scan from the network.

#### DHCP

DHCP is responsible for assigning IP address information automatically to systems on the network.

When a client starts up, it sends out a broadcast message looking for a DHCP server to receive an IP address from. The DHCP server repliesd with an offer, and the client then requests the address that has been offered. Finally, the DHCP service acknowledges that the client has the address for a period of time (lease duration).

#### Network Address Translation

NAT enables us to hide our internal network structure from the outside world by having the NAT device receive all outbound packets, take the interal source address out, and replace it with the public IP address of the NAT device.

#### Wireless Access Points/Access Points

An *access point* is a device added to your network that enables wireless clients to connect to the network.

#### Wireless LAN Controllers

You can centrally manage devices instead of nedding to run aroung to each device and perform the configuration.
Administrators can use a wireless LAN controller (WLC), to manage access points centrally using the Lightweight Access Point Protocol (LWAPP).

#### Cisco DNA Center

Cisco DNA Center is appliance you can purchase that enables you to manage changes to your network devices centrally and simultaneously.

#### Endpoints and Servers

* **Client**
	* A client system, connects to the network to access resources such as files, printers, or the Internet
* **Server**
	* A server system provides resources to the network.

### Collision Domains and Broadcast Domains

#### Collision Domain

In a collision domain, data transmission collisions can occur.

For example, suppose you are using a hub to connect five systems to a network. Because traffic is sent to all ports on the hub, it is possible that if several systems send data at the same time, the data could collide on the network.
For this reason, all network ports on a hub (and any devices connected to those ports) are considered parts of a *single collision domain*.

If you were using a switch to connect the five systems together, each port on the switch would create its own network segment. When data is sent by a system connected to the switch, the switch sends the data only to the port that the destination system resides on. For this reason, if another system were to send data at the same time, the data would not collide. As a resoult, each port on the switch creates a *separate collision domain*.

#### Broadcast Domain

A broadcast domain is a group of systems that can receive one another's broadcast messages.

When using a hub to connect five systems in a network environment, if one system sends a broadcast message, the message is received by all other systems connected to the hub. For this reason, all ports on the hub create a *single broadcast domain*.

Likewise, if all five systems were connected to a switch and one of the systems sent a broadcast message, the broadcast message would be received by all other systems on the network. Therefore, when using a switch, all ports are part of the same broadcast as well.

You could use VLANs on a switch with each VLAN being a different broadcast domain.

### Ex 1-1: Identifying Network Components

* **Switch**
	* A layer 2 device to connect all systems to the network
* **Collision domain**
	* A group of systems in which separate data transmissions could potentially collide
* **DHCP**
	* A service that assigns IP addresses to other systems and devices on the network
* **Firewall**
	* Used to protect a system or device from unwanted traffic
* **Router**
	* A layer 3 device responsible for sending data from one network to another
* **Hub**
	* A layer 1 device used to connect all systems to the network
* **IPS**
	* A device that detects suspicious activity and then takes corrective action
* **Demarc**
	* The point where in which separate data transmissions could potentially collide
* **Broadcast domain**
	* A group of systems that can receive one another's broadcast messages

### Network Design Models

When designing Cisco networks, usually follow two common design models: the *three-tier architecture model* and the *collapsed core architecture model*.

#### Three-tier Architecture

* **Access layer**
	* This layer is at the bottom of the hierarchy; it enables end users to connect to the network via switches.
	* Isloate traffic between different types of users and divide broadcast domains.
	* A switch located on each floor of building would represent this layer.
* **Distribution layer**
	* The second layer from the bottom (or the middle layer), enables you to control who can access what part of the network by using features such as routing, access control lists, and network access policies.
* **Core layer**
	* The top layer of the model represents the backbone of the network.
	* This layer typically used to connect the network of different buildings together.
	* It includes a number of core routers that are responsible for delivering traffic to and from the network.

#### Collapsed Core (Two-tier) Architecture

A small organization may not need to use a three-layer model, so it can combine the distribution and core layers into a single layer known as a *collapsed layer*.

##### Spine-leaf Architecture

![[Pasted image 20251122072130.png]]

Leaf layer contains the access switches that enable devices to connect to the network. The leaf layer then connect to the spine layer switches, which connect all the switches to the rest of the network.

## Network Topologies

The *topology* of the network is the layout of the network.

![[Pasted image 20251122072357.png]]

A *point-to-point* topology has a single connection between two components. In this topology, two components can directly communicate without interference from other components.

In a *star* topology, a central device has many point-to-point connections to other components.
The main problem with start topology is that if the center of the star fails, no components can communicate with others. To solve this problem, an extended star topology can be used. An extended start topology is basically multiple interconnected star topologies.

In a *bus* topology, all components are connected to and share a single wire.
With a bus topology, if any system sends data on the wire, the data travels the entire length of the wire.

In a *ring* topology, device one connects to device two, device two connectes to device three, and so on to the last device, which connects back to the first device.
Ring topologies can be implemented as a single ring or a dual ring. Dual rings are typically used when you need redundancy.

### Physical vs. Logical Topologies

A *physical* topology describes how components are physically cabled together. A *logical* topology describes how components communicate across the physical topology. The physical and logical topologies are independent of each other.

| Network Architecutre | Physical topology            | Logical topology |
| -------------------- | ---------------------------- | ---------------- |
| Ethernet             | Bus, star, or point-to-point | Bus              |
| FDDI                 | Ring                         | Ring             |
| Token Ring           | Start                        | Ring             |

### Fully and Partially Meshed Topologies

*Meshing* generically describes how components are connected together.

![[Pasted image 20251123033846.png]]

> The formula used to determine the number of links needed to fully mesh a WAN is `N x (N - 1) / 2` while `N` is the number of locations.

## Types of Cabling

### Copper Cabling

Between copper and fiber, implementing copper cabling is less expensive.
Three types of copper cabling have been used with networks:

* **Thicknet**
	* Uses a thick coaxial cable
* **Thinnet**
	* Uses a thin coaxxial cable
* **Unshielded twisted pair (UTP)**
	* Uses four pairs of wires in the calbe, where each pair is periodically twisted

Of the three copper cabling types, UTP is the most common today, mainly because it is cheaper than the other two and is easier to install and troubleshoot.

Copper cabling has two disadvantages:

* It is susceptible to electromagnetic interference (EMI) and radio frequency interference (RFI)
* Distances of the cable are limited to a shour haul (100 meters)

#### UTP Categories

| Category    | Desc                                                            |
| ----------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Category 1  | Used for telephone connections (not suitable for data)          |
| Category 2  | Used for data connections up to 4 Mbps (Token Ring)             |
| Category 3  | Used for data connections up to 10 Mbps (Ethernet 10BaseT)      |
| Category 4  | Used for data connections up to 16 Mbps (Token Ring)            |
| Category 5  | Used for data connections up to 100 Mbps (Ethernet)             |
| Category 5E | Used for data connections up to 1 Gbps (Ethernet)               |
| Category 6  | Used for data connections up to 1 Gbps (Ethernet)               |
| Category 6A | Used in 10 Gigabit Ethernet networks with speeds up to 10 Gbps  |
| Category 7  | Used in 10 Gigabit Ethernet networks with speeds up to 10 Gbps  |

Each of the endpoints of UTP cable has an RJ-45 connector, which is a male connector that plugs into a female RJ-45 receptacle.
The RJ-45 connector is similar to what you see on a telephone connector (RJ-11), except that the RJ-45 is about 50 percent larger in size and holds eight wires instead of four wires, as is the case with RJ-11.

#### Cabling Devices

Two types of implemantations are used for the pinouts of the two sides of the wireing : *straight through* and *crossover*.
*pinout* refers to the order of the wires and the pins they connect to within the RJ-45 interface. Two standards define the cabling pintouts: 568B is used for both straight-through calbes and one end of a crossover cable.

**568B**

| Pin | Color                      |
| --- | -------------------------- |
| 1   | White wire / orange stripe |
| 2   | Orange wire                |
| 3   | White wire / green stripe  |
| 4   | Blue wire                  |
| 5   | White wire / blue stripe   |
| 6   | Green wire                 |
| 7   | White wire / brown stripe  |
| 8   | Brown wire                 |

A straight-through Ethernet UTP cable has pin 1 on one end of the cable connected to pin 1 on the other end of the cable, pin 2 to pin 2, and so on.
A straight-through cable is used to connect dissimilar devices together.

**Straight-through connections**

* PC/server - switch
* PC/Server - hub
* Router - switch
* Router - hub

A crossover UTP Etherent cable crosses over two sets of wires: pin 1 on one side connected to pin 3 on the other side, and pin 2 is connected to pin 6. Crossover cable is used to connect similar devices together.

**Crossover connections**

* Switch - Switch
* Switch - Hub
* Hub - Hub
* PC/server - Router
* Router - Router
* PC/server - PC/server

Sometimes the Ethernet network interface card (NIC) female receptacle will give you a clue as to the type of cable to use. If an *X* appears on the port and the other port doesn't have an *X* label, use a straight-through cable. If neither device has an *X* or both have an *X*, use a crossover cable.
In some instances, this setting can be changed in software with a command of in hardware through the use of dual inline package (DIP) switch, which enables you to use the cable type that you currently have available.

### Fiber

Fiber-optic cabling is typically used to provide very high speeds and to span connections across very large distances. However, fiber-optic cabling does have its disadvantages: it is expensive to implement, difficult to troublesoot, and difficult to install.

> Fiber cabling is not affected by EMI and RFI.

Two types of fiber are used for data connections: multimode fiber (MMF) and single-mode fiber (SMF).

MMF transmits 850- or 1300- nanometer wavelength of light. Fiber thickness for MMF is 62.5/125 microns. The core and cladding diamter is in the 50 to 100 micron range for MMF. MMF's relatively large core diameter supports the propagation of multiple longitudinal modes at a given wavelength; thus the term *multimode* used.

SMF transmits 1300- or 1550-nm light and uses a laser as a light source. Because lasers provider a higher output than LEDs, SMF can span more than 10 kilometers in distance and have speeds up to 100 Gbps.
Because of SMF's very small core diameter, only a single longitudinal mode is propagated at a given wavelength.

The past decade has seen many advances in the use and deployment of fiber. One major enhancement is wavelength division multiplexing (WDM) and dense WDM (DWDM).
WDM allows more than two wavelengths (signals) on the same piece of fiber, increasing the number of connections.
DWDM allows yet more wavelengths, which are more closely spaced together: more than 200 wavelengths can be multiplexed into a light stream on a single piece of fiber.

*Cabling* provides the protective outer coating as well as the inner cladding. The inner cladding is denser to allow the light source to bounce off of it. In the middle of the cable is the *fiber* itself, which is used to transmit the signal.
The index of refraction (IOR) affects the speed of the light source: it's the ratio of the speed of light in a vacuum to the speed of light in the fiber.
IOR measures the density of the fiber; the denser the fiber, the slower the light travels through it.

The *loss factor* is used to describe any signal loss in the fiber before the light source gets to the end of the fiber. *Connector loss* occurs when a connector joins two pieces of fiber: a slight signal loss is expected. Also the longer the fiber, the greater the likelihood that the signel strength will decrease by the time it reaches the end of the cable. This is called *attenucation*.

Two other terms describe signal degradation. *Microbending* occurs when a wrinkle in the fiber, typically where the cable is slightly bent, causes a distortion in the light source. *Macrobending* occurs when the light source leaks from the fiber, typically from a bend in the fiber cable.
To overcome degradation over long distanced, *optical amplifiers* can be used. These are similar to an Ethernet reapeater or hub.

Two main standards are used to describe the transmission of signals across a fiber: SONET (Synchronous Optical Network) and SDH (Synchronous Digital Hierarchy).
SONET is defined by the Exchange Carriers Standard Association (ECSA) and American National Standards Institute (ANSI) and is typically used in North Americal.
SDH is an international standard used throughout most of the world.
Both of these standards define the pysical layer framing used to transmit light sources, which also includes overhead for the transmittion.

Three types of overhead are experienced:
* **Section overhead (SOH)**
	* Overhead for the link between two devices, such as repeaters
* **Line overhead (LOH)**
	* Overhead for one or more sections connecting network devices, such as hubs
* **Path overhead (POH)**
	* Overhead for one or more lines connecting two devices that assemble and disassemble frames, such as carrier switches or a router's fiber interface.

Typically, either a ring or point-to-point topology is used to connect the devices. With carrier metropolitan area networks (MANs), the most common implementation is through the use of rings. Auto-protection switching (APS) can be used to provide line redundancy.

**Fiber Connection Types**

| Common Term | SONET   | SDH    | Connection Rate |
| ----------- | ------- | ------ | --------------- |
| OC-1        | STS-1   | n/a    | 51.84 Mbps      |
| OC-3        | STS-3   | STM-1  | 155.52 Mbps     |
| OC-12       | STS-12  | STM-4  | 622.08 Mbps     |
| OC-48       | STS-48  | STM-16 | 2488.32 Mbps    |
| OC-192      | STS-192 | STM-64 | 9953.28 Mbps    |

SONET uses Synchronous Transport Signal (STS) and that SDH uses Synchronous Transport Module (STM) to describe the signal.

The most common types of fiber-optic connectors, and their typical uses:
* **Fiber Channel (FC)**
	* Used by service providers in their patch panels
* **Local Connector (LC)**
	* Used for enterprise equipment and commonly connect to small form-factor pluggable (SFP) modules
* **Standard Connector (SC)**
	* Used for enterprise equipment
* **Straight Tip (ST)**
	* Used for patch pannels because of their durability

Traditionally, SC was the most commonly used connector type; however, LCs are becomming more and more common.

**Cable Type Comprisons**

## Access Methods

An access method determines how a host will place data on the wire. There is three major access methods: CSMA/CD, CSMA/CA, and token passing.

### CSMA/CD

*Carrier-sense multiple access with collision detection* is one of the most popular access methods in use today.

With CSMA/CD, every host has equal access to the wire and can place data on the wire when the wire is free from traffic. If host wants to place data on the wire, it will "sense" the wire and determine whether a signal is already present. If it is, the host will wait to transmit the data; if the wire is free, the host will send the data.

The problem with the process just describes is that if two systems "sense" the wire at the same time, they will both send data at the same time if the wire is free.
When the two pieces of data are sent on the wire at the saame time, they will collide with one another and the data will be destroyed.
After a collision, each host will wait a variable length of time before transmitting the data, thereby preventing a collision the seconds. When a system determines that the data has collided and then retransmits the data, this is known as *collision detection*.

### CSMA/CA

With CSMA/CA, before a host sends data on the wire, it will "sense" the wire to see if it is free of signals. If the wire is free, the host will try to "avoid" a collision by sending a signal out, letting all others know they should wait before sending data.
This helps prevent collisions from occurring, but it involves sending more data on the wire.

### Token Passing

With both CSMA/CD and CSMA/CA, the possibility of collision is always there, and the more hosts that are placed on the wire, the greater the chances of collisions.

With token passing, an empty packet is running around on the wire (token). To place data on the wire, the system needs to wait for the token; once the system has the token and it is free of data, the system can place data on the wire.
Since there is only one token and a host needs to have the token to "talk", it is impossible to have collisions in a token-passing environment.

All systems will look at the data, but they will not process it, since it is not destined for them. However, the system that is the intended destination will read the data and send the token back to the sender as a confirmation. Once the token has reached the original sender, the token is unflagged as being used and released as an empty token onto the network.

## Network Architectures

### Ethernet

Many physical layer standards define the physical properties of an Ethernet implementation.
One of the most common is IEEE 802.3 10Mb.

**10Mbps Ehternet properties**

| Ethernet type | Distance Limit | Cable Type                     | Interface type | Physical Topology | Logical Topology |
| ------------- | -------------- | ------------------------------ | -------------- | ----------------- | ---------------- |
| 10Base5       | 500m           | Thick coaxial cable (thicknet) | AUI            | Bus               | Bus              |
| 10Base2       | 185m           | Thin coaxial cable (thinnet)   | BNC            | Bus               | Bus              |
| 10BaseT       | 100m           | UTP cabling                    | RJ-45          | Star(hub)         | Bus              |

Ethernet supports a bus topology. In a bus topology, every device is connected to the same piece of wire and all devices see every frame.

All of these 10 Mbps Ethernet solutions support only half-duplex.

### Fast Ethernet

All Ethernet standards uses CSMA/CD as the access method with Fast Ethernet running at 100 Mbps. The older 10 Mbps Ethernet is half duplex, Fast Ethernet is full duplex.

**Fast Ethernet Properties**

| Ethernet type | Distance Limit                         | Cable Type                                    | Interface type | Physical Topology | Logical Topology |
| ------------- | -------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- | -------------- | ----------------- | ---------------- |
| 100BaseTX     | 100m                                   | UTP CAT 5, 5E, 6, 6A                          | RJ-45          | Star              | Bus              |
| 100BaseFX     | 400m (half-duplex) 2000m (full-duplex) | MMF 62.5/125 micron with SC and ST connectors | RJ-45          | Star              | Bus              |
| 100BaseT4     | 100m                                   | UTP CAT 3,4,5                                 | RJ-45          | Star              | Bus              |

### Gigabit Ethernet

Gigabit Ethernet is defined in IEEE 802.3z. To achieve 1-Gbps speeds, IEEE adopted the ANSI X3T11 Fiber Channel standard for the physical layer implementation.
The physical layer is different from Ethernet and Fast Ethernet in that it uses an 8b/10B encoding scheme to code the physical layer information when transmitting it across the wire.

Gigabit Ethernet connections are commonly used for uplink connections (switch-to-switch) and server applications.

**1Gbps Ethernet Properties**

| Ethernet type | Distance Limit | Cable Type                   |
| ------------- | -------------- | ---------------------------- |
| 1000BaseCX    | 25m            | STP copper                   |
| 1000BaseLX    | 3-10km         | SMF                          |
| 1000BaseSX    | 275m           | MMF                          |
| 1000BaseT     | 100m           | CAT 5E and CAT 6 UTP (RJ-45) |
| 1000BaseZX    | 100m           | SMF                          |

### 10-Gigabit Ethernet

| Ethernet type | Distance Limit | Cable Type           |
| ------------- | -------------- | -------------------- |
| 10GBaseSR     | up to 400m     | Short range MMF      |
| 10GBaseLR     | up to 10km     | long range SMF       |
| 10GBaseER     | up to 40km     | extra-long range SMF |
| 10GBaseT      | up to 100m     | CAT 6A UTP           |

### Serial, Optical, and Other Architectures

#### Serial

Many network technologies deliver data in serial fashion, which means they deliver the data in a stream of bits, one after the other.
Serial connections are typically used with WAN connections, enabling your network to connect to other networks through a provider.

#### Optical

There are also special WAN versions of 10-Gigabit Ethernet that use fiber-optic cabling to connect to a SONNET network:

* **10GBaseSW**
	* Short-range MMF
	* up to 10m
* **10GBaseLW**
	* Long-range SMF
	* up to 10km
* **10GBaseEW**
	* extended-range SMF
	* up to 40km

#### Concepts of PoE

PoE is known as the IEEE 802.af standard and is a method of delivering power to devices using the Ethernet port.

### GBICs

A *gigabit interface converter (GBIC)* is an input/output (I/O) device that is plugged into a Gigabit Ethernet Interface (and 10Gbps connectors) and provides various interface connector types.

The advantage of GBICs, your device comes with a Gigabit Ethernet port and you buy the appropriate GBIC interface connector based on the cabling you'll be using. This means that if you ever need to change your cable requirements, you need to swap only your current GBIC for one that matches your new cabling needs.

### Troubleshooting Interface and Cable Issues

#### Collisions

With Ethernet networks, it is possible for two systems to send data on the network at the same time and for that data to collide.

This was a common issue when network hubs were used, because the hub would send the data to every port on the hub. Using network switches will help prevent collisions.
Also, if the line is busy with traffic, the switch can store the packet untile the line is free of a signal.

#### Errors

Network of packet errors can occur if there is faulty network card or faulty cables.
If corrupt packets are received, the sending system will need to retransmit the data, which in the end uses up more bandwidth.

#### Mismatch Duplex

The duplex setting on either end of the communication should match.

#### Speed

The speed of network interface must match the speed ot the other end of the communication.

## Virtualization Fundamentals

### Hypervisors

Virtualization of systems is provided by the *hypervisor*. Also known as the virtual machine monitor (VMM), the hypervisor is the software component that enables you to create and run virtual machines on a system, that system is called the host system, while each virtual machine is known as a guest system.

There are two different types of hypervisors:

* **Type I**
	* This hypervisor type is software that runs directly on top of the hardware, which then has the host operating system running as a parent virtual machine.
	* This enables the hypervisor to control access to the hardware from the host and the guest systems.
	* These are also known as bare-mettl hypervisors.
* **Type II**
	* This type involves having the OS installedd on top of the hardware, and then installing virtualization software that will create VMs.

## Chapter Review

### Introduction to Networks

* A network includes all of the hardware and software components used to connect computers across a distance.

### Common Network Services and Devices

* DHCP is a service that assigns IP address to systems on the network.
* A DNS server converts friendly names to IP addresses
* A network-based firewall is used to control what traffic is allowed to enter or leave the network. The firewall filters traffic by analyzing the header of the packet and deciding if it is allowed in, based on the firewall rules.
* An access point is a device that connects to the network and enables wireless clients to connect to and gain access to the network.

### Network Topologies

* A point-to-point topology uses a single connection between two devices and is typically used in WAN environments.
* In a star topology, a central device makes many point-to-point connections to other devices.
* A bus topology uses a single connection between all devices.
* A ring topology connects one device to the next, where the last device is connected to the first.

### Types of Cabling

* Copper cabling with Ethernet commonly uses UTP, a four-pair wire.
* Straight-through UTP cables are used to connect dissimilar devices. Crossover UTP cables are used to connect similar devices.
* In fiber-optic cabling, a glass core carries pulses of light and is immune to electrical interference. Two implementations of fiber-optic include MMF for shorter distances and SMF for longer distances.

### Access Methods

* CSMA/CD is sensing the wire before sending data on the wire
* In token passing, the system needs to wait for the token before it can pass a token on the wire.
