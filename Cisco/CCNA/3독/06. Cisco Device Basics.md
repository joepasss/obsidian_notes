## Understanding Memory Types

### Read-Only Memory (ROM)

The software in ROM cannot be changed unless you actually swap out the ROM chip on your Cisco device.

ROM is nonvolatile, meaning that when you turn off your device, the contents of ROM are not erased. ROM contains the firmware necessary to boot up your router and typically has the following three components:

* **Power-on self-test (POST)**
	* Performs tests on the device's hardware components
* **Bootstrap program**
	* Brings the router up and determines how the IOS image and configuration files will be found and loaded.
* **ROM Monitor (ROMMON)**
	* A mini-OS that enables you to perform low-level testing and troubleshooting.

### Flash Memory

Flash is form of nonvolatile memory, like ROM, meaning that when you turn the router off, the information stored in flash is not lost.

Routers store their IOS image in flash, but other information can also be stored here, such as a secondary configuration file.

### Volatile RAM (VRAM)

Like RAM in computer in the sense that it loses its contents when you shut the system down.
On a router, volative RAM, somethimes just referred to as RAM, contains the running IOS image, the active configuration file (known as running-config), any tables (including routing, ARP, and other tables), and internal buffers for temporarily storing information such as interface input and output buffers and logging messages.

### Non-Volatile RAM (NVRAM)

NVRAM is like flash in that its contents are not erased when you turn off your router. It is slightly different, though, in that it uses a battery to maintain the information when the Cisco device is turned off.

Routers (and switches) use NVRAM to store the configuration files, including the startup config, which is applied to the device during bootup after the IOS is loaded.

| Term            | Desc                                    |
| --------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| Flash Memory    | Contains the IOS image files            |
| Volatile RAM    | Contains the running configuration file |
| ROM             | Contains bootstrap and ROMMON programs  |
| Nonvolatile RAM | Contains the startup configuraiton file |

## Starting the Cisco Device

### Boot Process

A router typically goes through six steps when booting up:

1. The router loads and runs POST (Power-on Self-test, located in ROM), testing its hardware components, including memory and interfaces.
2. The bootstrap program is loaded and executed
3. The configuration register is checked to determine how to boot up (where to find the IOS image and configuration file).
4. The bootstrap program finds and loads an IOS image. Possible locations of IOS images include flash or a TFTP server.
5. Once the IOS is loaded, the IOS attempts to find and load a configuration file, which is normally stored in NVRAM. If the IOS cannot find a configuration file it starts up the *System Configuration Dialog*.
6. After the configuration is loaded, you are presented with the CLI (remember that the first mode you are placed into is user EXEC mode).

### Bootstrap Program

The bootstrap program found the IOS and loaded it. The bootstrap program goes through the following steps when trying to locate and load the IOS image:

1. It examines the configuration register value. This value is a set of four hexadecimal digits. The last digit affects the bootup process.

**Fourth Hex Character Configuration Register Values**

| Value   | Bootup process                                                                                           |
| ------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 0x0     | Boot the router into ROMMON mode                                                                         |
| 0x1     | Boot the router using the first IOS in flash or the Mini-IOS in ROM (RXBOOT mode), if the latter exists. |
| 0x2-0xf | Boot the router using the default boot sequence                                                          |

2. It examines the configuration file in NVRAM for *boot system* commands, which tell the bootstrap program where to find the IOS.
3. If no *boot system* commands are found in the configuration file in NVRAM, it uses the first valid IOS image found in flash.
4. If no valid IOS images are in flash, it generates a TFTP local broadcast to locate TFTP server (this is called *netboot* and is not recommended, because it is very slow and not very reliable for large IOS images).
5. If no TFTP server is found, it loads the Mini-IOS in ROM (RXBOOT IOS images).
6. If there is a Mini-IOS in ROM, it loads the Mini-IOS and enters RXBOOT mode; otherwise, the router either retries to find an IOS image or loads ROMMON and goes into ROMMON mode.

You can use the following *boot system* commands to influence the order that the bootstrap program should use when trying to locate the IOS image:

```
Router(config)# boot system flash NAME_OF_IOS_FILE_IN_FLASH
Router(config)# boot system tftp IOS_IMAGE_NAME IP_ADDR_OF_SERVER
Router(config)# boot system rom
```

You can tell the bootstrap program to load the Mini-IOS in ROM with the `boot system rom` command.
To remove any ot these commands, just preface them with `no` parameter.

> When the router is booting and you see the message "boot: cannot open "flash:""; this indicates you misconfigured a `boot system` command and the corresponding IOS image filename in flash doesn't exist.

### System Configuration Dialog

When a router boots up, runs its hardware diagnostics, and loads IOS software, the IOS then attempts to find a configuration file in NVRAM.
If it can't find a configuration file to load, the IOS runs the *System Configuration Dialog*, commonly referred to as *Setup mode*, which is a script is to ask you questions that will enable you to set up a basic configuraiton on your router: It is not intended as a full-functioning configuraiton tool.

#### Running the System Configuration Dialog

One way to access the System configuration Dialog is to boot up a router without a configuration in NVRAM.
The second way is to use the `setup` command.
