how to devide one network address range into multiple network ranges, or subnets, so that you can assign each address range to separte network(subnet) in your internetwork (network made up of multiple networks).

Each segment will need its own network address range so that the router can route (send) the data from one network to another. if, for example, you had two physical networks but kept the single IP range without subnetting, the router would "logically" think that all systems were on the same network and would never try to route data from one side to the other.

## Understanding Subnetting

You subnet a network ID to break the single logical network address into multiple logical network addresses so that you can assign a logical network ID and related addresses to each physical network segment on your network. In order to do this, you have to manipulate the subnet mask at the bit level and essentially take host bits away and convert them to subnet bits.

### Subnetting Class A Networks

you have an address range of 10.0.0.0 and you will divide the network into four subnetworks(subnets).

**Physical structure**
![[스크린샷 2025-04-25 14.57.40.png]]

Subnetting involves taking some of the host bits from the subnet mask and using them as additional network bits, which will give you more networks. With subnetting, you are taking additional host bits and "masking" them (flagging them as network bits) by setting the bits to a 1 state so that they are no longer representing the host ID portion of the subnet mask. This creates additional networks, but in results in fewer hosts on each of the networks.

To begin, you need to know how many host bits are required to make the desired number of networks. To calculate how many bits are needed to subnet into four networks (subnets):

```
2^masked_bits = number of subnets
```

For example, if you are looking for four subnets, (2^2 = 4). So you would steal, or mask, two of the host bits in the subnet mask and make then netowork bits (these called subnet bits)

Now that you know that two bits must be masked to create the four subnets, the next step is to look at your IP range of 10.0.0.0 and get default subnet mask(255.0.0.0) Once you know the default subnet mask, your next step is to break the subnet mask down into binary. A default class A decimal subnet mask in binary looks like:
![[스크린샷 2025-04-25 15.21.08.png]]

now can begin to calculate the new addresses of the four subnets. The first ting you need to do is steal, or "mask", two bits from the host ID portion of the subnet mask and make them subnet bits by setting then to  a 1 state.
![[스크린샷 2025-04-25 15.22.25.png]]

that the two bits are now enabled are in the second octet. Also, always work from left to right in the subnet mask

### Calculate the New Subnet Mask

Now you can calculate the new subnet masks for all four networks. To do this, you convert the new binary value in the preceding table of `11111111.11000000.00000000.00000000` to its decimal notation (255.192.0.0) as the new subnet mask of your four new subnets.

The next step is to calculate the IP ranges for the four different networks, but before that, you need to know five pieces of information about each of the new subnets you are designing before this walkthrough is complete:

* New subnet mask
	* After subnetting a network, you will have a new subnet mask that is used by all subnets you have created.
* Network ID
	* To calculate the network ID for each network, all host bits are set to 0.
* First valid address
	* To calculate the first valid address, you set the least significant host bit to 1; all other host bits are 0.
* Broadcast address
	* To calculate the broadcast address for each subnet, you set all host bits to 1.
* Last valid address
	* To calculate the last valid address, you set the least significant host bit to 0; all other host bits are 1.

**LSB (Least Significant Bit)**
값이 가장 작은 비트 (8비트일때, 000000001)

*MSB (most significant bit)*
값이 가장 큰 비트 (8비트일 때, 10000000)

### Calculate the Network ID

To calculate the network IDs for each of the subnets, you need to determine all of the on/off states of the number of bits that you have converted from host bits to subnet bits.
ex) two bits were used as subnet bits to create more networks, so there are four possible on/off states with two bits: 00, 01, 10, and 11. These are listed out in your binary work area and should look like:
![[스크린샷 2025-04-25 17.16.39.png]]

Next, you add in the remaining 0s to the bits that represent the host ID portion. (original network ID was 10.0.0.0), so the first octet will start with 10, no matter what you change in the binary, because you are starting you work with the second octet.

The next step is to bring the 10 down to the first octet; each network ID will start with 10 because that is what it was originally. After bringing the 10 down in the first octet, you then calculate the network ID of each of the two networks by leaving all host bits set to 0 (the nonbolded bits), as shown in the following table:
![[스크린샷 2025-04-25 17.19.18.png]]

In this example, because the two subnet bits are being manipulated, and because all host bits are set to 0, the four network IDs are created: 10.0.0.0, 10.64.0.0, 10.128.0.0, and 10.192.0.0

**새로운 subnet mask를 생성한 뒤 Network ID 계산**

IP주소가 10.0.0.0 을 가지는 네트워크 에서 2개의 서브넷 마스크를 생성했다고 가정하면, 서브넷 마스크는 255.0.0.0 에서, 255.128.0.0 으로 바뀜 (11111111.10000000.00000000.00000000)

second octet 에서 가능한 서브넷 마스크는, 00000000 (0) 과, 10000000 (128)이 있음, 이때 각 Network ID는:
* Network 1: 10.0.0.0
* Network 2: 10.128.0.0

으로 생성됨.

IP주소가 30.0.0.0 을 가지는 네트워크에서 4개의 서브넷 마스크를 생성했다고 가정하면, 서브넷 마스크는 255.0.0.0 에서 255.192.0.0 으로 바뀜

```
# subnet original
11111111.00000000.00000000.00000000

# subnet split
11111111.11000000.00000000.00000000
```

second octet 에서 가능한 서브넷 마스크는

```
00000000 0
01000000 64
10000000 128
11000000 192
```

이때 각 network ID

```
30.0.0.0
30.64.0.0
30.128.0.0
30.192.0.0
```

### Calculate First Valid Address

the first address that can be assigned to a host on each of these networks. To calculate the first valid address, simply enable the least significant bit
![[스크린샷 2025-04-25 19.20.23.png]]

### Calculate the Broadcast Address

To calculate the broadcast address, you will enable all of the host bits, and then convert each octet from binary to decimal.
![[스크린샷 2025-04-25 19.21.50.png]]

### Calculate the Last Valid Address

To calculate the last valid host address of each subnet, simply subtract 1 from the broadcast address by disabling the least significant bit
![[스크린샷 2025-04-25 19.23.57.png]]

### Verify the Network Size

* Number of subnets
	* To verify the number of subnets, use the formula
	* `2^subnet_bits = number of subnets`
* Number of hosts per subnet
	* To verify that you are supporting the correct number of hosts per subnet, use the formula
	* `2^host_bits - 2 = number of hosts per subnet`

## Classful vs. Classless Adressing

Each IP address that you use on a system falls into one of the three primary classes: class A, class B, or class C. This is known as classful addressing.

### IP Subnet Zero

some networking devices and protocols could not use the first and last subnets created when divided network into multiple subnets. This was because some of the older routing protocols did not send the subnet mask information along with the network ID when the router shared information about network.

This meant that if the network is subnetted, let's say into four subnets, when a router shared knowledge of the 192.168.1.0 network, the receiving router had no way to know if it was subnetted or the entire 192.168.1.0 network.

Today's routing protocols send the subnet mask information with the route something like 192.168.1.0/26 so there is no question that this is the first of four subnetted networks.

Cisco devices can use the first and last subnets when subnetting network, because the ip subnet-zero command configured on the device indicates that we can use the first and last subnets. If the command was changed to no ip subnet-zero, we would not be allowed to use the first and last subnets on the router

## Variable Length Subnet Masks

each of the subnets has the same number of IP addresses assigned to it. This sometimes can waste addresses, because there may not be a need for the same number of IP addresses within each subnet.
![[스크린샷 2025-04-26 15.37.09.png]]

> Subnet #1 has 21 Hosts
> Subnet #2 has 2 Hosts
> Subnet #3 has 56 Hosts

Subnet 3 requires 56 hosts, so to calculate the subnet information, you need to determine how many hosts bits you need to create a subnet that supports 56 hosts.

`2^host_bits - 2 = number of host supported`

in order to support the 56 hosts on subnet 3

`2^6 = 64 -2 = 62 hosts supported on subnet 3`

keep in mind that using 6 bits for host bits gives you a few more host addresses than what you require, but you cannot go any lower, because five host bits would support only 30 (30 - 2) hosts.

Also not that although you are supporting 62 hosts with this subnet, the number of addresses is 64 (this is know as the block size, or subnet size).

you can now document the subnet mask for subnet 3 as follows:
```
11111111.11111111.11111111.11000000 = 255.255.255.192
```

now to show what address range this is, you can plot the network on a grid showing the different IP addresses used in the fourth octet. Note that subnet 3 will be using a block a 64 addresses, but you can use only 62 of them. This means numbers 0-63 are the addresses for subnet 3
![[스크린샷 2025-04-26 21.04.34.png]]

Notice that this is documented as 216.83.11.0/26.

Now look at the next highest number of hosts on the network, and you'll see that subnet 1 requires 21 hosts (or 21 IP addresses). To calculate the subnet block for this:
```
2^5 = 32 -2 = 30 hosts supported on subnet 1
```

you can now document the subnet mask for subnet 1 as follows:
```
11111111.11111111.11111111.11100000 = 255.255.255.224
```

![[스크린샷 2025-04-26 21.07.12.png]]
subnet 3 is using address 0-63, subnet 1 will start at 64 and go for 32 addresses, which will be to 95

This means numbers 64-95 are the addresses for subnet 1, that this is documented as 216.83.11.64/27

The last subnet to add our planning grid is subnet 2. Because we need only two IP addresses on this subnet (one for each side of the WAN link),
```
2^2 = 4 - 2 = 2 hosts suppported on subnet 2
```

```
11111111.11111111.11111111.11111100 = 255.255.255.252
```

![[스크린샷 2025-04-26 21.10.37.png]]

this is documented as 216.83.11.96/30.

Addresses 100-255 are still available

### Exercise 5-3: Using VLSM on a Network

The network address you have to subnet is 200.45.6.0
![[스크린샷 2025-04-26 21.46.46.png]]

Subnet #1: 108 Hosts
Subnet #2: 2 Hosts
Subnet #3: 38 Hosts

| Subnet | Subnet Mask     | Network ID      | First Valid IP  | Last Valid IP   | Broadcast Addr  |
| ------ | --------------- | --------------- | --------------- | --------------- | --------------- |
| #1     | 255.255.255.128 | 200.45.6.0/25   | 200.45.6.1/25   | 200.45.6.126/25 | 200.45.6.127/25 |
| #2     | 255.255.255.192 | 200.45.6.192/26 | 200.45.6.193/26 | 200.45.6.194/26 | 200.45.6.195/26 |
| #3     | 255.255.255.252 | 200.45.6.128/30 | 200.45.6.129/30 | 200.45.6.190/30 | 200.45.6.191/30 |

### Route Summarization

*Route  summarization* is the ability to take a bunch of contiguous network numbers in your routing table and advertise these contiguous route as a single summarized or aggregated route.

Route summarization enables you to summarize subnetted routes back to the class boundary. For instance, if you are using the network ID 192.168.1.0/24 and have subnetted it to 192.168.1.0/26, giving you four networks, you could summarize these subnets in your routing table and advertise them as the single class C network number 192.168.1.0/24
![[스크린샷 2025-04-27 00.41.04.png]]

the routing entries are reduced from four to one in your routing updates. Notice in this example that the same class network, 192.168.1.0, has two masks associated with it: 255.255.255.192 (identified with /26) and 255.255.255.0 (identified with /24)

### Advantages of Summarization

Summarization enables you to create a more effcient routing environment by providing advantages:
* It reduces the size of routing tables, requiring less memory and processing
* It reduces the size of routing updates, requiring less bandwidth.
* It prevents routing table instability

few disadvantages:
* The summary route may contain subnets that are not in use, and the router may receive packets for routes that are not in use, although they do mathematically fall under the summary route. In this case the router will drop those packets.
* The router may choose a different pathway for the route because the pathway is more specific than that of the summary route.

To calculate the summary route, first list out each of the network IDs and then convert them to their binary forms.
![[스크린샷 2025-04-27 12.03.28.png]]

Next, identify from left to right, how many of the bits are the same with those four network IDs.
![[스크린샷 2025-04-27 12.04.06.png]]

Notice that in the first two bits of the fourth octet, the bits start to change for each subnet, All of the bits before that point are common bits to create summary route. you get a summary route of 192.128.1.0/24

## Classless Interdomain Routing (CIDR)

*Classless Interdomain Routing (CIDR)*, specified in RFC 2050, is an extension to VLSM and route summarization. With VLSM, you can summarize subnets back to the class A, B, or C network boundary.

if you have a class C network 192.168.1.0/24 and subnet it with a 26-bit mask, you have created four subnets. Using route summarization, you can summarize these four subnets back to 192.168.1.0/24.

CIDR takes this one step further and enables you to summarize a block of contiguous class A, B and/or C network numbers. This practice is commonly referred to as *suppernetting*. Today's classless protocols support suppernetting. However it is most commonly configured by Internet service providers (ISPs) that use the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) for routing
**example of CIDR**
![[스크린샷 2025-04-27 12.13.45.png]]
a router is connected to four class C networks. It is summarizing those routes as 192.168.0.0

how this is performed with CIDR. CIDR is an extension of VLSM and route summarization so the technique to summarize those class C networks is the same as that with route summarization.

Looking at the network addresses in binary, you identify the common bits to determine the summary network. Looking at the binary that follows, you can see that all the bits found in the first two octets of four networks are the same. In the third octet, the first 6 bits are the same as well, totaling 22 bits that are common to all networks (so that is our summary route). the subnet mask for this summarization: 255.255.252.0. This mask, along with the beginning network of 192.168.0.0, includes addresses from 192.168.0.0 to 192.168.3.255
![[스크린샷 2025-04-27 12.57.43.png]]

Because there needed to be a standard method of indicating how many bits in the IP address were network bits, CIDR notation was created. With CIDR notation, you specify the IP address and a forward slash (/), followed by the number of bits that make up the network ID.

### Questions

1. You have a network ID of 131.107.0.0 and you would like to subnet your network into six networks. What is your new subnet mask?

6개로 서브넷을 자르려고 하면, 2^2 = 4, 2^3 = 8 이므로, 8개로 분할해야함. 지금 CIDR 표기법을 사용하지 않았으므로, classful 표기법이라 가정하면 네트워크 아이디를 131.107.0.0 로 가지는 class는 class B이고 class B는 default subnet mask 로 255.255.0.0 을 가짐. 여기서 네트워크 비트가 3개 더 필요하므로, 새로운 서브넷 마스크는 `11111111.11111111.11100000.00000000` 이 되고, 10진수 값으로 표기하면, 255.255.224.0 이 됨

= 255.255.224.0

2. You want to divide your network into eight networks. How many bits will you need to take from the host ID portion of the subnet mask?

2^3 = 8이므로, 네트워크 비트를 3개 추가해야함 (host에서 빌려와야함)

= 3

3. In binary, how do you calculate the broadcast address of a network range?

바이너리에서 브로드캐스트 주소를 계산하려면, 모든 호스트 비트를 enable (1로 변경) 하면 됨

= All host bits set to 1

4. in binary, how do you calculate the network ID of a network range?

바이너리에서, network ID를 계산하려면, 모든 호스트 비트를 disable (0으로 변경) 하면 됨

= All host bits set to 0

5. The last valid address of a subnet is always

= One less than the broadcast address

6. You need to assign an IP address to the router that uses the fourth valid address of 200.56.88.96/27. Which address would you use?

200.56.88.96/27 의 네 번째 address 를 사용한다고 했으므로, (네트워크 아이디라고 가정함)

= 200.56.88.100

7. Your system has an IP address 138.97.25.10/20. Which of the following is a system on your network?

Subnet Mask: 11111111.11111111.11110000.00000000, 255.255.240.0

호스트 비트가 12개 있으므로 할당 가능한 호스트 갯수는 2^12 - 2 = 1022개임, 138.97.25.10/20 (네트워크 ID라고 가정, CIDR표기법 사용했으므로)은 138.97.25.10 부터 138.97.
??? 모르겠음

8. Which fo the following is an example of CIDR notation?

= 10.34.56.78/16

9. Your router has an IP address of 216.83.11.65/27. You want to connect a new system on the network. Which of the following addresses would you assign to that new system

Subnet Mask: 11111111.11111111.11111111.1110000, 255.255.255.224

호스트 비트가 4개 있으므로, 할당 가능한 호스트 갯수는 2^4 - 2 = 14개, 즉 할당 가능한 범위는 216.83.11.66-216.83.11.80
???? 모르겠음

10. You are configuring the gigabit interface on the Cisco router with the last valid IP address of the 131.107.48.0/20 network. What address would you use?

Subnet Mask: 11111111.11111111.11110000.00000000

이거도 모르겠음
