## Understanding Threats and Attack Types

### Fundamentals of Security

#### Confidentiality

The first goal of information security is to keep information confidential, which means not allowing unauthorized individuals to access the information.

**methods to maintain confidentiality**
* You can configure permissions on files and/or folders to block unauthorized individuals from accessing these files and/or folders.
* You can encrypt the data in storage so that they only people with the decryption key can gain access to the data. (known as *encrypt-in-storage*)
* You can encrypt the data as it travels across the network or Internet. (known as *encrypt-in-transit*).

#### Integrity

Integrity deals with being to ensure the integrity of the data that is being read. If, for example, an employee stores a file on the server and the next month access that file, how does show know that the file has not been tampered with or altered?
You can use technologies that offer integrity services to identify whether the file has been altered.

A common technique to prove the integrity is *hashing*.
With hashing, the data (in this case, a file) is run through a hashing algorithm to generate an answer (known as a hash value).
This hash value is then stored for reference at a later time. The next time you read the file, you run the file through the same hashing algorithm to generate a new hash value. You then compare the two hash values: if the two has values are the same, the file has not been altered.

Common examples of hashing algorithms are Message Digest 5 (MD5) and Secure Hashing Algorithm 1 (SHA-1) and 256 (SHA-256).

#### Availability

The third goal of information security is availability. If an employee stores a report on the server, for example, he expects the report to be there later when he needs it.
We can use a number of technologies to increase the chances that a company asset, such as that report, is available

* **Backups**
	* If we make backups of the file server and the server crashes, we can restore the company data from the backups.
* **RAID**
	* Servers have multiple drive configured in a RAID array, so that if a drive fails, employees will still be able to access the company data.
* **Clustering**
	* Servers are places in a highly available cluster, so that if one server fails, the other server can handle the workload.
* **FHRP**
	* You con configure your Cisco router in a first hop redundancy protocol (FHRP) topology, so the if a router fails, another router can take over and employees can still gain Internet or WAN access.

### Vulnerabilities and Exploits

* **Threat**
	* An action that exposes a compromise to confidentiality, integrity, or the availability of an asset.
	* Example threats include denial-of-service (DoS) attacks (which violate availability) or an attacker hacking a database and retrieving credit card number (which violates confidentially).
* **Threat actor**
	* The person or group causing the threat to occur.
	* Common examples are hackers and disgruntled employees.
* **Vulnerability**
	* A weakness in a product that could enable someone to bypass the security of the product and gain access to or cause damage to the system.
	* Every product has vulnerabilities, which is why we need to patch systems regularly.
	* As the product vendor learns of a vulnerability, it ships out the fix in a software patch
* **Exploit**
	* An activity that takes advantage of a system or a software vulnerability to compromise security.
	* Individuals take advantage of system or software vulnerabilities in order to compromise security, leading to an exploit.
* **Mitigation technique**
	* The method used to reduce the likelihood or impact of a threat or to remove it entirely.
	* For example, to mitigate a Dos attack, we could create multiple servers in highly available solution.
	* Or to mitigate a potential attacker's access to credit card numbers, we could encrypt the credit card numbers included in the database.

### Common Vulnerabilities

A number of common configuration mistakes can lead to vulnerabilities on your systems and devices.

**common vulnerabilities**
* **Unnecessary running services**
	* Be sure to assess the service running on a computer and then disable any unnecessary ones.
	* The more software running on a system, the more likely vulnerabilities exist that the hacker can use to gain access to it.
* **Open ports**
	* A Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) or User Datagram Protocol (UDP) port open on the system is an invitation for a hacker to gain access to the system.
	* Close any open ports on the system that are not needed, and use a firewall to block access to ports that must remain open.
* **Unpatched systems**
	* Be sure to keep your systems up-to-date with patches and security fixes.
	* That way, any software on the system is less likely to have vulnerabilities that a hacker can exploit
* **Unencrypted channels**
	* Ensure that any communication channels between systems are encrypted as much as possible.
	* Using unencrypted communication enables hackers to capture the traffic and read the information.
* **Clear-text credentials**
	* Ensure that any communication protocols being used are encrypting the password when users are authenticating to the systems.
	* Replace any unsecure authentication protocols with a secure authentication protocol
* **Unsecure protocols**
	* Be sure to encrypt all communication.
	* Most Internet protocols are daily, such as telnet, HTTP, File Transfer Protocol (FTP), Trivial File Transfer Protocol (TFTP), and Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMPv1 and SNMPv2), send traffic in an unencrypted format.
	* If an attacker captures unencrypted traffic using a sniffer program, he can view the details of the traffic, access any sensitive information in that traffic, and potentially learn the username and password being used to authenticate to the system.
	* Be sure to investigate each protocol used on the network; if it is not encrypting communication, find a secure replacement for the protocol. For example, instead of using telnet for remote administration of your Cisco device, use Secure Shell (SSH).

### Malicious Software

Another common form of hacker attack is through malicious software.

Malicious software is any software that is designed to harm a system, and it comes in many forms.

* **Virus**
	* The traditional virus is attached to a file, so that when you open the file, the virus is activated and infects your system.
	* Viruses can delete files from the system or modify the boot sector so that the computer no longer boots.
* **Warm virus**
	* Today, we usually deal with worm viruses
	* A warm virus is a self-replicating virus, which means that it can infect your system without you opening a file.
	* Warms can arrive as attachments in e-mails, instant messages, or through software vulnerabilities.
	* Or it may be present on a flash drive that infects your system when you connect the flash drive to your computer.
	* A worm virus infects one computer and then spreads across your entire network.
* **Trojan virus**
	* A Trojan virus is a program that you are tricked into installing because you believe the application does something useful; in reality, however, the program is a virus that infects your system.
	* The Trojan virus typically modifies your system by opening a TCP/IP port, which allows a hacker to connect to the system and take control of it.
* **Spyware**
	* This hidden software monitors and collects information about you and your internet surfing habits.
	* Spyware has also been known to do more than just monitor for information: it can make changes to your system through browser redirection (sending you to a different web page) or slow down your network connection.
* **Adware**
	* This software automatically loads advertisements on your screen, typically in the form of pop-up windows.
	* The advertisements are designed to entice you into purchasing products or subscribing to particular web sites.
* **Logic bomb**
	* This type of virus is planted on your system with the intention of infecting it later.
	* After an infected application is installed, the logic bomb waits until a particular condition is satisfied, such as a specific date, and then the virus performs its malicious purpose.
* **Keylogger**
	* A Keylogger is either a piece of software or a hardware device installed on your system that is designed to capture all of your keystrokes in an attempt to learn your passwords and other information.
* **Spam**
	* Spam refers to unsolicited commercial e-mails.
	* These e-mail messages typically are mass mailed, and their purpose is to convince you to purchase their products or services.
	* The spammers (people who send the spam messages) usually get your e-mail address from a web site or newsgroup after you have posted a comment to the group.
* **Ransomware**
	* This malicious software takes control of your system and does not give control back until you pay a fee.
	* In a recent common scenario, ransomware encrypts your drive, and you must pay a fee to get the encryption key.

### Mitigating Attacks

common mitigation techniques that can help you prevent attacks of reduce the impacts of attacks:

* **Patch systems**
	* The first step you can take to protect your systems is to ensure that you have a patch management strategy in place.
	* Make sure that you keep all systems up-to-date with patches, because they remove known vulnerabilities from your system.
	* Most operating systems and applications have an automatic update feature that you can enable so that updates are downloaded and applied automatically as they are released.
* **Encrypt network traffic**
	* To protect your data from prying eyes, ensure that you are encrypting all network communication.
	* This include encrypting web, e-mail, and FTP traffic, if need be.
* **Encrypt data stored on mobile devices**
	* Ensure that you are encrypting data that is stored on laptops and other mobile devices.
	* Employees may lose their devices, or their mobile devices may be stolen at some point, so it is critical that data stored on these devices is encrypted and that the devices are password protected.
* **Use strong passwords**
	* Ensure that you are using strong passwords for all user accounts and devices.
* **Run hashing algorithms**
	* You can verify the integrity of data by running it through a mathematical hashing algorithm, which generates a hash value.
	* The server uses a key to create a hash value with a password stored on the server and then compares the resulting value with the hash value sent by the client. If the two hash values are the same, the client has supplied the correct password. If the has values are different, this indicates that the data has been changed in some way.
	* Examples of hashing algorithms are MD5 and SHA

### Attack Types

#### Social Engineering Attacks

With a social engineering attack, the attacker compromises the network or system through social interaction with an individual through an e-mail message or phone call, tricking the victim into divulging information that can be used to compromise security.

The information the victim divulges to hacker would most likely be used in a subsequent attack to gain unauthorized access to a system or network.

Education is the key to protecting yourself and fellow employees from social engineering attacks. Keeping all personal aware of the popularity of social engineering attacks and the different scenarios that could be examples of such attacks will help raise the security level of the organization.

**Common social engineering attack**

* **Attacker impersonates administrator**
	* the attacker may call an employee and impersonate the company's network administartor.
	* The hacker will try to convince the employee to change his or her password or divulge password information so that the attacker can use the information to access the system.
* **Attacker impersonates user**
	* The attacker calls an unsuspecting network administrator and plays the role of a frustrated user who cannot log on to the network.
	* The network administrator naturally helps the "user" by resetting his or her password and helping the person log on, which result in giving the attacker access to the system.
* **Attacker impersonates vendor**
	* The attacker may e-mail a customer and pretend to be a vendor of a piece of software.
	* The attacker tries to convince the user to install an update, but the user doesn't realize the update is actually a Trojan virus that gives the attacker access to the system.

#### Phishing Attack

A common type of social engineering attack in use these days, a phishing attack occurs when the hacker creates a fake web site looks exactly like a popular web site.

The attacker sends on e-mail message trying to trick the user into clicking a link that leads to the fake site (called "phishing").
When the user attempts to log on to the fake site with his or her account information, the attacker records the username and password and then tries using that information to log on to the real site, potentially gaining access to the user's account.

There are several forms of phishing attacks.
*Spear phishing* is focused on a specific victim or group of victims. In general, phishing attacks are sent to random e-mail addresses, but in spear phishing, the attacker poses as a known or trusted sender and targets specific individuals or groups.

*whaling attack* is form of phishing attack that is targeted at company executives, such as a CEO.

#### Network-Based Attacks

Most types of attacks are considered network-based attacks, in which the hacker performs the attack from a remote system.

* **Eavesdropping attack**
	* Also known as *packet sniffing*
	* eavesdropping involves the use of a network monitoring tool known as a sniffer, which is used to capture and analyze network traffic.
	* If the traffic is not encrypted, the hacker could read confidential data, including usernames and passwords.
* **Spoofing**
	* In a spoof attack, the hacker modifies the source address of the packets he or she is sending so that the packet appears to be coming from someone else.
	* Spoofing is common method to bypass access controls placed on switches, routers, or firewalls.
	* *different types of spoofing*
		* *MAC spoofing*
			* involves altering the source MAC address of a packet.
			* It is common for an attacker to spoof the MAC address so that he can bypass the MAC filtering features on a wireless network or attempt to bypass the port security features of a switch
		* *IP spoofing*
			* involves altering the source IP address of a packet.
			* An attacker may use IP spoofing to attempt to bypass access control lists (ACLs) on a router or firewall.
		* *E-mail spoofing*
			* involves altering the source e-mail address of an e-mail message.
			* E-mail spoofing is typically used by an attacker in a phishing attack to make e-mail look like it is coming from someone else (a trusted party).
* **Man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack**
	* With an MITM attack, the hacker inserts himself in the middle of two systems that are communicating.
	* He then passes the information back and forth between the two, with neither party knowing all the communication is passing through the hacker's system.
	* The benefit of this is the hacker can then view an sensitive data sent between the two systems.
* **Hijack attack**
	* A hacker takes over a session between you and another individual and disconnects the other individual from the communication. You still believe that you are talking to the original party and send private information to the hacker instead of the original party.
* **Denial of service**
	* A denial-of-service (DoS) attacker causes the system or its service to either crash or become unresponsive. As a result, the system cannot fulfill its purpose and provide those services.
	* For example, your web server that it becomes overwhelmed too busy to service valid request from your customers.
* **Distributed denial of service**
	* With a DDoS, the hacker uses multiple systems to attack a single target system.
	* A good example is the smurf attack, in which the hacker pings a number of computers but modifies the source address of those packets so that they appear to come from another system (the victim, in this case).
	* When all of these systems receive the ping request, they will reply to the same address, essentially overburdening that system with data.
* **Buffer overflow**
	* In a buffer overflow attack, the attacker sends more data to a buffer than it can hold.
	* The data may include malicious code that may corrupt data or cause private information to be revealed, providing the attacker the ability to gain administrative access to the system in a command prompt or shell.
* **Exploit attack**
	* In this type of attack, the attacker knows of a security problem (a vulnerability) within an operating system or a piece of software and leverages that knowledge by exploiting the vulnerability.
* **Botnet**
	* A botnet is a group of systems that a hacker takes over and uses in a DDoS attack.
* **DNS poisoning**
	* With DNS poisoning, a hacker alters (or poisons) your DNS data in order to redirect clients to the wrong system.
	* In another common attack against DNS, a hacker tries to do a zone transfer (copy your DNS data) in order to map out your network.
* **Smurf attack**
	* In a smurf attack, the hacker sends a ping message to a number of systems but spoofs the IP address so that it looks like the ping messages are coming from different systems.
	* The result is that all the systems send ping replies to the victim, essentially performing a DDoS.
* **Friendly/unintentional DoS
	* Some scenarios can lead to an unintentional DoS attack.
	* For example, an account lockout policy could lead to a DoS, preventing the user from logging on once the account is locked.
	* User may also unintentionally cause a DoS if they delete a file by accident.
* **Physical attack**
	* Physical attacks occur when the attacker gains physical access to your facility and is able to cause damage to your equipment or even the facility.
	* Implementing physical security controls, such as locking mechanisms and guards, can help prevent these attacks.
* **ARP poisoning**
	* A hacker can insert herself in the middle of communication by altering the Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) cache on a victim's system and causing all communication to pass through the hacker's system, enabling her to capture all traffic.
	* This is a common method to perform an MITM attack.
* **VLAN hopping**
	* VLAN hopping is an exploit against virtual local area networks (VLANs) that enables an individual to gain access to a VLAN when he is not connected to it.
	* Hackers accomplish this by double-tagging the frames for different VLANs, or they can imitate a trunking port so that they receive all traffic.
* **Deauthentication**
	* A deauthentication attack is common in wireless attacks.
	* The hacker sends a command to disconnect or deauthenticate the client from the wireless network. As a result, the client is forced to reauthenticate with the wireless network where hacker can capture the reauthentication traffic.
	* The authentication packets can be replayed by the attacker in order to generate more traffic in hops of cracking the wireless encryption.
* **Zero-day attacks**
	* In a zero-day attack, a vulnerability unknown by the software developer is exploited before the developer realizes the problem and issues a patch.
	* Companies can have a team in place to test software and identify vulnerabilities not yet known.

#### Password Attacks

An attacker may try to crack the passwords stored in a network account database or a password-protected file.

* **Dictionary attack**
	* This attack involves the use of a word list file, which is a list of potential passwords.
	* The attacker uses a program to read any try each of the passwords from the file to break into a system.
	* This is a very quick form of password attack, because no calculations are required: the attacker is simply reading a file
* **Brute-force attack**
	* The attacker uses a program that tries every possible combination of characters to guess a password.
	* This attack is slower than a dictionary attack because a file is not read; instead, the program calculates each possible password.
* **Hybrid attack**
	* Like a dictionary attack, a hybrid attack involves a word list file, but it also places numbers at the end of the words to catch passwords that are not dictionary words, in cast a password contains a number at the end, which is common.

## Authentication and Authorization Concepts

### Authentication

Authentication is the process whereby users or computers identify themselves to the network so that they can start accessing network resources or a network device (in the case of managing the device).

The method used to authenticate a user depends on the network environment and can assume forms such as following:

* **Username and password**
	* When the userstarts the computer or connectes to the network, she types a username and password that are associated with the user's particular network account.
* **Smartcard (PKI cards)**
	* Using a smartcard for logon is similar to accessing your bank account at an ATM.
	* To log on to the network, you insert a smartcard, which is similar to a debit card, into a smartcard reader and then supply a PIN.
	* To be authenticated, you must have the smartcard and know its password.
	* Smartcards are also known as PKI cards because they are used to authenticate the client in a public key infrastructure (PKI) environent; the card contains the employee's private ey.
* **Biometrics**
	* In this case, the user provides a retina scan or fingerprint as a credential.

Whatever method is used to provide the necessary credentials, the outcome is the same.
For example, if the username and password are correct, the user is authenticated and allowed to access network resources.
Network servers also have the ability to authorize users to access different resources, depending on how they are authenticated. For example, authentication username and password authentication can provide.

If the credentials are incorrect, authentication fails and the user is denied access to the network.

When users provide credentials, the credentials are passed to the server using an authentication method.
A number of authentiation methods:

* **Password Authentication Protocol (PAP)**
	* PAP sends user's credentials in plain text and is very insecure, because it is easy for someone to analyze and interpret the logon traffic.
* **Challenge Handshake Authentication Protocol (CHAP)**
	* With CHAP, the server sends a client a challenge (a key), which is combined with the user's password.
	* Both the user's password and the challenge are run through the MD5 hashing algorithm, which generates a hash value, or mathematical answer, and that hash value is sent to the server for authentication.
	* The server uses the same key to create the hash value with the password stored on the server and then compares the resulting value with the hash value sent by the client.
	* If the two hash values are the same, the client has supplied the correct password.
	* The benefit is that the user's credentials have not been passed on the wire at all.
* **Microsoft Challenge Handshake Authentication Protocol (MS-CHAP)
	* MS-CHAP is a variation of CHAP and uses the MD4 hasing algorithm rather than MD5.
	* MS-CHAP also uses the Microsoft Point-to-Point Encryption (MPPE) protocol along with MS-CHAP to encrypt all traffic from the client to the server.
* **MS-CHAPv2**
	* With MS-CHAP version 2, the authentication method has been extended to authenticate both the client and the server.
	* MS-CHAPv2 also uses stronger encryption keys than CHAP and MS-CHAP.
* **Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP)**
	* EAP allows for multiple logon methods (smartcard, certificates, Kerberos, and public-key).
	* EAP is also frequently used with Remote Authentication dial in User Service (RADIUS), which is a central authentication service that can be used by RAS, wireless, or VPN solutions.

#### Password Alternatives

Other authentication techniques can be used outside of typing a username and/or password:

* **Biometrics**
	* With biometric authentication, you will need to present an aspect of yourself to authenticate to the system.
	* For example, the system may scan your fingerprint, take a retina scan, or use facial or use voice recognition.
* **Certificates**
	* You may be required to have a certificate to authentiate to a system.
	* A certificate is an electronic file that contains encryption keys and other properties, such as the owner's ID and who created the certificate.
	* The certificate is typically stored on a PKI card (smartcard), or it could be on a USB stick.
	* Certificates can be used as a password-less form of authentication that can be configured on your Cisco device for SSH remote access.

#### Authentication Factors

An individual can be authenticated using any of the following authentication factors:

* **Something you know**
	* This is the most common authentication factor, where you know information to prove your identify.
	* An example of this authentcation factor is knowing a password or a PIN
* **Something you have**
	* Also a common authentication factor, this is based on your having something in your possession that enables you to gain access to the environment.
	* For example, you use a swipe card or physical token to enter a building.
* **Something you are**
	* You can gain access to a system by using this more advanced authentiation factor.
	* This authentication factor involves biometrics: you use a characteristic of yourself for authentication, such as a retinal scan, fingerprint, or voice recognition, to prove your identity.
	* This is considered the most secure method of authentication

In addition to the proceding factors, you should be familiar with several other factors of authentication.

If you are authenticating to a system by using only one of the authentication factors, you are using a *single-factor authentication* scheme.
For example, knowing the username and password is a single-factor authentication scheme because they are both example of something you know.

A *two-factor authentication scheme* is based on two authentication factors, such as something you know and something you have.
For example, you have a bank card (something you have) and you know the PIN to use the bank card in an ATM.
This authentication scheme is much stronger than simply needing to have the bank card to gain access to your account.

**Common examples of two-factor authentication schemes:**

* **Physical token and password**
	* You authenticate with something you have and something you know
* **Smartcard and PIN**
	* You authenticate with something you have and something you know.
* **Biometrics and password**
	* You authenticate with something you are and something you know
* **Logon credential, and tehn access code from mobile phone notification**
	* In this example you would log on with your username and password, and then a notification is sent to your phone with a one-time access code you will need to type when logging into the application.
	* This is an example of something you know (username and password), and something you have (the phone).

Multifactor authentication (MFA) requires you to log in with two or more factors.
Suppose you need an authentication code to log into a site.

You enter your username and password (something you know), and you use your phone (something you have) to receive an authentication code. Once you receive the code, you enter that on the site to complete the login process.
This is an importanat feature that should be used with any web site login to ensure that if someone is able to get your password they cannot log into the site as you because they do not possess your phone.

Although two-factor authentication is the more common form of MFA you can have more such as three-factor authentication.
An example of three-factor authentication is if you are required to do a retina scan (something you are), swipe a card (something you have), and then insert the PIN associated with that card (something you know).

#### Single Sign-On (SSO)

Single sign-on (SSO) is an important concept regarding authentication.
When you authenticate to the network that offers SSO, you can access multiple systems based on that single authentication information.
So with SSO, you are not required to authenticate with each different system you access (you authenticate once and then can gain access to multiple systems without authenticating again).

Using SSO, you don't have to authenticate with each server individually.
before SSO was available, logging on to each system required a separate username and password, so users had to remember various passwords to access more than one server.
With SSO, the user logs on with one set of credentials, a token is generated, and the token is then presented to the other trusted servers on the network to enable the user to access resources on the network.

### Authorization

Once you have been authenticated to the network, you will be authorized to access network resources.
There are various types of authorization, depending on what it is that you are trying to be authorized for.
For example, if you are trying to access a file on the network, authorization is determined according to the permissions assigned to the file. If you are trying to change the time on the server, authorization is determined by your privileges, or rights.

From a Cisco networking point of view, authorization is implemented as *access control lists*, which are configured on the router to allow or deny traffic from entering or leaving the network.

#### Permissions vs. Rights

Permissions and rights are examples of authorization used on endpoints such as workstations and servers.

A *permission* is your level of access to a resource such as a file, folder, or object.
The permission is a characteristic of the resource and not a characteristic of the user account.
For example, if an administrator wanted to give Bob read permission to a file, the admin would go the the properties of that file and set the permissions. Notice that the admin does not go to the user's account to assign the permissions

*Right* is your privilege within the OS to perform a particular task.

#### Controlling Traffic

A Cisco example of authorization is the access control list (ACL). To authorize which traffic is allowed to enter or leave different parts of your network, you will configure rules on your firewall or Cisco routers.

The ACL is a list of these rules that either permit or deny different types of traffic from entering or leaving your network.
The router receives a packet and then typically allows or denies the packet based on the protocol, the source or destination IP address (IP filtering), or the source and destination port (port filtering).

#### Network Access Control (NAC)

Network access control (NAC) is enables you to authorize who can gain access to a wired or wireless network based on the state of the connecting system, known as *posture assessment*.
With NAC, you can specify conditions are not met, the user can be sent to a restricted network, where he can take actions to remedy the problem.

For example, you may require that for a system to connect to the network, it must have antivirus software installed, and the antivirus definitions must be up-to-date. You may also require that the system have a personal firewall enabled. If any of these conditions is not met, the NAC system places the client on a restricted network, where the user can typically apply patches or, in this case, perform an update of the virus definitions.

Today, NAC is used in many scenarios:

* **Connecting to wireless**
	* When connecting to a wireless network, the NAC system may require you to accept the terms of wireless network usage before you are given access to the network.
* **Patch status**
	* A client connects to a network, either locally or through VPN, and the client's health is checked to ensure that it has antivirus software installed, that virus definitions are up-to-date, and that the system is up-to-date with patches before the client is allowed to connect to the network.
* **Connecting to a switch**
	* If the switch is 802.1x-compliant, it can be configured to ensture that the connecting client is authenticated by an authentication service (such as RADIUS) before allowing the client access to the network.

#### Port Security

Another common method used to authorize who gain access to the network is to implement *port security* on your Cisco switches.

The port security feature of a switch enables you to control which systems can connect to individual ports on the switch according to their MAC addresses.

#### Network Segmentation

It is important to ensure that you separate different types of systems, or environments, from one another to help increase security.
For example, a hotel that provides wireless access to its guests would ensure that the systems from the wireless network are not connected with the hotel's corporate systems.

You typically segment systems by not providing a physical connection between two networks, or, if you need to have a physical connection, you use a router or firewall to control communication between the types of systems using ACLs.
VLANs are also a great Cisco switch feature to help implement different network segments.

In the following scenarios, it is important to implement network segmentation:
* **Legacy systems**
	* You may want to separate a legacy system from the rest of the network because the legacy system is running older software or protocols.
	* Of you may want to segment the legacy system because it is older and potencially not as secure as newer systems, because patches for the old system are no longer being provided.
	* Having the older system connected to the same network with newer systems would lower the security of the newer systems.
* **Separate private/public networks**
	* You sould separate the private network (your LAN) from any untrusted public network (such as the Internet) to help reduce chances of attacks from the Internet.
* **Honeypots/honeynets**
	* A honeypot is a system or network designed to attract a hacker to attack it instead of attacking a production system or network.
	* You want to ensure that you segment the honeypot environment from the production environment so that a hacker who is tricked into trying to hack into the honeypot does not see the production system or network.
* **Testing labs**
	* Any test environment should be segmented from the production network.
	* One good reason to do this is a test lab typically uses the same IP addresses and the computer names that the production systems are using, so you want to make sure that the systems are not on the same network to prevent IP and name conflicts
* **Performance optimization and load balancing**
	* You may choose to segment systems as a way to load balance some of the work.
	* For example, instead of having all users connect to one server for service, you can place that service on two different servers, which are each on a different network. This way, each network is being serviced by one server with half the traffic.
	* You could also load balance traffic by having a separate switch or wiring closet for each floor and have that floor connect to a layer 3 switch to segment the traffic of each floor from traffic of the others.
* **Compliance**
	* You may need to separate systems using different segemtns to comply with regulations or other requirements.
	* For example, a vendor may not support a product unless it is separated from different types of systems.
	* Regulations governing your orgaization may also have compliance requirements that involve controlling communication to systems that store sensitive data.
	* For example, the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCIDSS) requires isolating any system storing or processing credit card data on its own network segment.

### Accounting

After the individual authenticates to the system, she is then authorized (or not authorized) to perform different actions on the system or network.

*Accounting* then kicks in, tracking and logging the actions that the user performs while accessing the system or network.
Accounting is very important to security; by logging user actions, the user is held accountable for all of her actions.

**activity that my be tracked**
* **Internet usage**
	* Log each web site that the user visits
* **File access**
	* Log each time a user accesses certain files on a server or, more importantly, each time a user deltes or copies a file.
* **Database access**
	* Log when a user accesses certain data in a database or changes or deletes data in the database.

### AAA Services

The services of authentication, authorization, and accouning are collectivley known in the industry as AAA services.

* **Authentication**
	* The authentication service is responsible for validating the credentials presented by the user and typically involves having an authentication databse of criteria.
	* For example, when a user logs on with a username and password, that information is verified against an account databse.
* **Authorization**
	* Once the account information has been verified, the user is granted access to the network.
	* The authorization component may need criteria other than account information before granting access.
	* For example, the authorization service may require that the authentication requrest come from a specific subnet.
* **Accounting**
	* Accounting deals with logging activity performed by users and administrators, so that users can be held accountable for their actions.
	* Accounting can also be used to help determine how much money each department should be paying for the service.

Many AAA solutions have been released over the years, such as RADIUS and TACACS+.
These services offer the benefit of a central system that can offer authentiation, authoriaztion, and accounting for many types of environments, such as wired network, wireless networks, and VPNs.

#### RADIUS

Remote Access Dial-In User Service (RADIUS) is a central authentication service that has been poplular for many years.

The client computer that needs access to the network connects to the network by attempting to connect to a switch or wireless access point, or by making a connection to a VPN server from across the Internet.
In this case, the switch, wireless access point, or VPN server is known as the RADIUS server that is running in the backgroun.
This RADIUS server verifies the credentials and sends back a reply that indicates whether the network client is to be granted or denied access.

#### TACACS and XTACACS

TACACS originated as an authentication service that ran on UNIX systems.
TACACS services used TCP and UDP port 49. A few yearss after TACACS was introduces, Cisco created its own proprietary authentication service called *Extended TACACS (XTACACS)*, which worked as a central authentication service for Cisco devices.

#### TACACS+

The TACACS+ protocol is the AAA protocol used by Cisco networks and supersedes the original TACACS and XTACACS protocols.

TACACS+ uses TCP for communication and uses the same topology used by RADIUS in the sense that the client tries to connect to the Cisco switch, and the switch, which is the TACACS client in this case, sends the authentication request to the TACACS server.

TACACS + has been improved over RADIUS from a security standpoint, because it encrypts all information between the TACACS client and the TACACS server, whereas RADIUS encrypts only the password between the RADIUS client and the RADIUS server.

## Password Policy Elements

### Password Complexity

One of the most important concepts related to password is ensuring that users understand the importance of having a complex password.
A *complex password* is a password that is at least eight characters long and requires the inclusion of lowercase letters, uppercase latters, numbers, and symbols.

The problem with using complex passwords, however, is that they are difficult to remember.

### Password Policy

To enforce strong password and good password practices, you will need to configure a password policy to control how passwords are used on your systems.

**common policy elements**

* **Minimum password length**
	* Specify how long a password must be.
* **Maximum password age**
	* Specify how frequently (in days) users will need to change their passwords.
* **Password history**
	* Specify that a user cannot change a password to a password they've already used.
* **Minimum password age**
	* Specify how long users must keep a password before they are allowed to change it again.
	* The purpose of this policy is to stop someone from voluntarily changing his password a large number of times in a row to remove a password from the password history, which would enable him to reuse an old password, bypassing the password history requirement.
* **Complexity requirements**
	* Specify that the password include uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols.

### Account Lockout Policy

An account lockout policy helps you protect user accounts from being hacked.
With an account lockout policy, you specify that after a certain number of bad logon attempts, an account will be locked and cannot be used.

### Account and Password Management

As a network administrator, you'll perform a number of tasks to manage user accounts and passwords to help create a secure environment.
Your first two steps are to create a password policy and an account lockout policy, but you may need to perform other actions as well.

#### Password Expiration

Password policies are set to expire after a maximum amount of time.
Suppose, for example, that you set a user's password expiration to 30 days. This means that after a user has used a password for 30 days, it wwill expire.
The next time the user logs on, she'll be asked to change her password. If anything goes wrong with a password reset, you may need to reset the password for a user with your user account management tool.

#### Disable Accounts

If an employee takes a leave from work, such as parental leave, or quits his job, the first thing you should do is disable the user's account so that the employee cannot log on and use that account.

#### Remove Unnecessary Accounts

Every so often, you should admit the user accounts that exist in your environment and identify those that are no longer needed and can be removed. you disable an account that is not needed for a period of time at first (to see if anyone complains), and then, if you are sure the account is no longer necessary, you can delete the account.

## Remote Access and VPNs

Remote Access concepts such as virtual private networks (VPNs), remote access protocol such as Cisco AnyConnect, site-to-site VPNs, and remote administartaion protocols such as telnet, SSH, and RDP are common in network environments today.

### VPN Overview

Once the Internet became popluar, allowing users in remote (off-premises) location to communicate with distance networks was an obvious solution.
For example, if you had an office in New York and a user in a hotel room in Boston needed to access the New York network, what better solution than use the Internet? Of course, many security issues are involved in sending data across the Internet, because the entire world of hackers may tap into your network

Virtual private networks (VPNs) offer a solution. With a VPN, the user in the Boston hotel can connect to the Internet using a Wi-Fi connection provided by the hotel.
Once the Internet connection is achieved, the user can use the IP address of the VPN server in New York to create a "secure tunnel" between her laptop (the client system) and the VPN server in New York. With a VPN, any data that travels between the two systems will be encrypted and therefore will be considered secure.

VPNs offer two major benefits: they provide secure communication across an unsecure medium, and no costs are incurred to communicate between the two locations.
Once all systems have an Internet connection, VPN solutions leverage that connection and add security to it.

#### VPN Protocols

**common protocols to secure VPN traffic**
* **Point-to-Point Tunneling Protocol (PPTP)**
	* This older VPN protocol is used to encrypt Point-to-Point (PPP) traffic and is common in older MS environments.
	* PPTP uses the Generic Routing Encapsulation (GRE) protocol to transport the PPP packets, but is uses MS Point-to-Point Encryption (MPPE) protocol to encrypt the traffic.
	* To allow PPTP traffic to pass through the firewall, you will need to open TCP port 1723 (control port) and protocol ID 47 (carries the data) on the firewall.
* **Layer 2 Tunneling Protocol (L2TP)**
	* L2TP is newer VPN protocol than PPTP.
	* L2TP uses the more secure IPsec (Internet Protocol Security) for encryption of traffic instead of MPPE.
	* To allow L2TP traffic through your firewall, you will need to open UDP port 500 (for key exchange), UDP port 5500 (for IPsec NAT), and UDP port 1701 on the firewall.
* **Secure Socket Transport Protocol (SSTP)**
	* The SSTP protocol is a common VPN protocol today and is the newest of the three protocols listed.
	* SSTP has a benefit in that it uses Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) to encrypt the VPN traffic, making it easy to configure the firewall to allow VPN traffic to pass through (you simply need to open the SSL port 443).

**security protocols**
* ***Generic Routing Encapsulation (GRE)**
	* GRE is a networking protocol that is designed to create a point-go-point tunnel between two devices.
	* As a tunneling protocol, GRE is used to establish the point-to-point link and then encapsulate other types of traffic, such as IPv4 or IPv6 packets, into the GRE packet.
	* GRE is a common protocol used to set up a VPN tunnel between two Cisco routers.
* **IPsec**
	* This protocol is used to encrypt all IP traffic once IPsec has been configured on the system or device.
	* The IPsec protocol uses Encapsulation Security Payload (ESP) to encrypt traffic, Authentication Header (AH) protocol for message integrity and authentication, and Internet Key Exchangge (IKE) to exchange encryption keys between systems.
* **ISAKMP**
	* The Internet Security Association and Key Management Protocol (ISAKMP) is responsible for setting up a secure channel (known as a security association) and exhanging keys.
	* ISAKMP used by IKE for authentication before key exchange.

#### Remote Access VPNs

Users (or an administrator) can install VPN software on a laptop to connect over the Internet to a VPN server at work through a secure tunnel from the laptop to the company network.
This helps ensure the security of data traveling through the tunnel. The VPN software running on the company laptop uses one of the VPN protocols mentioned earlier to encrypt data from the laptop, across the Internet, and to the company network.

For example, a laptop user may have Cisco AnyConnect installed on his laptop to establish a VPN connection to the corporate network using SSL

#### Site-to-Site VPNs

Another common topology in use is the site-to-site VPN solution.
In this case, a VPN appliance, typically a router with VPN capabilities, is installed at each location that is used to create the encrypted tunnel from one location to another.

The clients are not establishing the tunnel, so they do not need a configured VPN connection to the remote location from their own system. Instead, they will go through a network device such as a router that will create the VPN tunnel to the other location.

Site-to-site VPNs are commonly used to connect branch offices to a head office.

The endpoint device has VPN software installed to create the secure tunnel, while ith a site-to-site VPN, the Cisco routers or ASA firewalls create the secure tunnel for that network location.

### Remote Administration Protocols

You'll often need to administer a device on the network from an offsite location. In *remote administration*, you will not be connected directly to the device through the console port, and you'll need to make administration changes from another part of the network or from across the Internet.

To manage these devices remotely, you will use a remote administration protocol.

**some common administartaion protocols**
* **Telnet**
	* enables you to connect to your switch or router and make administrative changes remotely.
	* It sends data in clear text, including the authentication traffic (username and password).
	* you should not use telnet for remote administration; instead use SSH to access onsite switches and routers.
* **SSH**
	* SSH sends all data in an encrypted format, including the authentication traffic (username and password).
	* If you need to manage your Cisco switches and routers, remotely ensure that SSH is the only protocol being used.
* **RIP**
	* The Remote Desktop Protocol is used for remote administration of workstations and server on the network.
	* You can use RDP to administer a computer located somewhere else on the network or on the Internet.

## Implementing a Security Program

### User Awareness

A key to improving security in any organization is to have a user awareness program that communicates the importance of maintaining security to protect the company's assets.
The user awareness program should explain the responsibility of each emmployee to uphold the organization's security prollicies.

Employees should be aware of a number of secure practices:
* **Not sharing passwords**
* **Using strong passwords**
* **Keeping doors shut and locked**
	* prevent unauthorized individuals from gaining physical access to the facility and its equipment
* **Keeping a clean desk**
	* keep information confidential.
	* should not leave confidential paperwork unattended on their desks for everyone to see.
* **Not cliking links from untrusted sources**

### Employee Training

Security training should be desinged to improve the company's overall security.

The security program should have a training element to it that identifies the different levels of training that each type of emplyee should have that is desiged to improve overall security to the company.
For example, all emplyees should take a one-day security awareness clieic that introduces the core security bet practices that all users should be following.

The employee traninig program can provide additional security tranning appropriate to each job role in the company.
For example, management should be trained how they can manage their staff to help them best maintain a secure work environment, while the technical team will require specialized traning that demonstrates how to implement different security controls to protect the company's assets.

### Physical Access Control

Physical security is one of the most important security concepts in any organization.

A variety of physical security mesaures can be used to ensure that unauthorized individuals cannot gain physical access to computers of devices.

#### Perimeter Security

The first line of defense in physical security is at the perimeter of the facility premises. Escpecially in highle secure environments, it is critial that you control who is allowed to neter the company's prperty, even outside the building.

Two popular methods of controlling access to company property are fences and security gurads.

##### Perimeter Fencing

In highly secure environments, installing a fence around the perimeter of the property can deter intruders from trespassing.
A fence around the premises can force individulas who want to aceess the facility to go through the main gates, where security guards monitor everyone who enters or leaves the facility.
