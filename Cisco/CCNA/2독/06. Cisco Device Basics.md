* **NCS 5000 Series**
	* An older model NCS routing solution, the NCS 5000 series is a routing platform designed for enterprise networks and service providers.
	* These routing devices provide 10 Gbps throughput using the Cisco XR software.

### Identifying Device Model Numbers and Serial Numbers

You can identify the model and serial number of your Cisco device by looking at the stickers typically located on the back of the device chassis (though they are sometimes displayed on the front).

You can use other methods to identify the type of Cisco hardware you are working with.
A Cisco router or switch device usually includes other markings, such as a logo displying the device model number.

You may also find markings that identify the model of the following devices:

* **Adapters**
	* These are network interface cards added to the Cisco device.
* **Modules**
	* Many different types of modules can be added to a slot on a Cisco device.
	* A common example of a module is a WAN interface card (WIC) used to install a T1 interface or a serial port to the router.
* **Line card**
	* This is a circuit board that provides LAN or WAN ports to high-end routers that are designed to accept line cards.

Each of these devices may have markings that indicate the type of device or the model of the device.
For example, if you look at the metal plate on a WIC module device, you will see the module type, such as WIC1DSU/T1, which is a T1 WAN interface card.

You can also find the model number and serial number of your Cisco device by using the `show version` command.

### Common Components on Cisco Devices

Each model devices is different with regard to the types of modules that it supports.
When purchasing your Cisco device, be sure to review the capabilities of the device to ensure that it meets your needs.

### Using Cisco Software

You need to be familiar with two aspects of the Cisco device: the software running on the device (the OS) and the hardware components of the device.

### Types of Software

* **Cisco IOS**
	* The Cisco Internetwork Operating System (IOS) is one of the more common operation systems used with Cisco devices.
	* The IOS provides the networking functions, protocols and security features of the device.
	* The Cisco IOS runs directly on the hardwareof the Cisco device.
* **Cisco IOS XE**
	* This operating system was originally released with the ASR 1000 and Catalyst 3850 Series routers.
	* If differs from the IOS in that IOS XE is a linux kernel that runs a version of the IOS on top of the kernel (which is why your IOS commands work with IOS XE).
	* By running a Linux kernel as the foundation of the OS, you can run different applications on the deivce.
* **Cisco IOS XR**
	* This Unix-based OS is totally different from the Cisco IOS, but is uses many commands similar to those used on the Cisco IOS.
	* Note, however, that all IOS commands may not necessarily work on the IOS XR.
	* This OS is geared toward service providers and is used with devices such as Cisco XR 12000 Series routers.
* **Cisco NX-OS**
	* This operating system is for Cisco Nexus series switches.
	* It is built on a linux kernel and supports Python as a scripting language for automating changes to the device.
	* Althrough it is different from the Cisco IOS, the commands used are very similar, which makes it easy for a technician to adapt to NX-OS.

#### Licensing Process

When you purchase your Cisco device, you must purchase licenses for the device, and if you replace a device with a newer device, you will need to obtain licenses for the new deivce.

Each Cisco device includes a number of software features.
For example, Cisco firewall products include malware protection features and URL-filtering features.
Each software feature, or *add-on*, requires that you acquire a software license to use it.

Part of licensing has to do with a support contract for the device and the features licesnsed for the device.
The support contract enables you to receive technical support from Cisco if there is a hardware failure or a problem with the OS.
There is also a support contract for the features being licensed, such as updates.

You can purchase two types of support contracts with your Cisco device:

* **SMARTnet (SNT)**
	* This support agreement covers hardware and offers services such as next-business-day replacement of failed hardware.
	* This agreement also enables you to receive updates on the device OS.
* **Software Support Service (SWSS)**
	* This support contract enables you to receive updates and support for any add-on features.

#### Bundle Mode and Install Mode

Cisco IOS XE switches, such as 3850 and the 3650, support two operation modes: bundle mode and install mode.

With bundle mode, the Cisco OS is stored as an image file in flash memory.
The device loads that image into memory on bootup

Install mode is the default mode used on switches and includes the provisioning file packages.conf to boot the Cisco switch.

The switch also contains a number of .pkg files in flash memory that are referenced by the packages.conf file.
Install mode is most beneficial if you are using a large number of switches, because you can perform an upgrade on all switches without needing to copy an image file.

### Working with Ports on Cisco Devices

You will see a number of different types of ports on the back or ront of a Cisco device.

**common ports**
![[Pasted image 20251007214704.png]]

#### Console Port

You connect your administrative workstation to the console port to administer the Cisco device locally. Which means you are sitting at the device to perform administrative tasks.

You wouls use a console cable, aka rollover cable, to connect the serial port of your computer to the console port on the Cisco device.
Then you would launch a terminal emulator program to administer the device from the CLI

You should know how to identify the console port on a Cisco device, which is usually labeled "Console" or "Con0".

#### Auxiliary Port

The auxiliary port, aka AUX port, is also used to connect to your Cisco router for administrative purposes, but it is designed to be an alternative method to administer your device remotely by connecting a modem to the AUX port, which then connectes to the phone jack in your wall.

Using this setup, you can dial into the router if it loses its Internet connection.
Typically, you could remote into the device with telnet or SSH if the device had an Internet connection.

**Typical setup of the AUX port**
![[Pasted image 20251007215312.png]]

> Although the purpose of the AUX port is to connect a modem, you can still connect your console cable directly to the port and administer the device locally like you would if you were using the console port.

#### LAN Ports

Cisco devices also include some form of Ethernet ports to connect to the LAN these are called interfaces.

The type of Ethernet ports will depend on the age of the device.
You may come across an older Cisco device with Ethernet ports, which Cisco uses as 10-Mbps ports.
Fast Ethernet ports run at 100 Mbps, Gigabit ports run at 1 Gbps, and 10 Gigabit ports run at 10 Gbps.

#### WAN/Serial Ports

The different types of Ethernet ports are used to connect to your LAN environment, but a Cisco router also needs to connect to the WAN environment to send traffic from one network to another if a company has multiple locations.

The serial interfaces on the Cisco router enable you to connect your Cisco router to other networks in two scenarios:
* **WAN link to service provider**
	* Connect to your service provider, or ISP, network
* **Back-to-back serial connections**
	* Create a point-to-point link directly between two routers.
	* This link is typically used in test environments or in a study lab for your CCNA exam.

#### WAN Link to Service Provider

To connect two office networks that are separated by some distance, you will subscribe to a montly service such as a T1 or T3 link from your local telco or service provider.

The telco provides the WAN network infrastructure to which your router's serial port connects to establish a link to the other location by way of the service provider's network.

![[Pasted image 20251007221149.png]]

On the left side of the figure are a router, a switch, and some client computers in the Vancouver Office.
The router has a serial interface with the identifier of s0/0/0 that is connected to an external channel service unit/data service unit (CSU/DSU).

You also plug the WAN link that comes from your service provider into the CSU/DSU; this component is responsible for sending and receiving data from the service provider's network, essentially acting as a modem for your entire network.

The CSU/DSU receives the data from the router for your entire entwork.
The CSU/DSU receives the data from the router and then converts it to a signal format that is used by the WAN infrastructure before sending the data to the service provider's network.
The data then travels through the many different WAN switches before reaching the CSU/DSU in Los Angels.'
The CSU/DSU in LA is responsible for converting the signal to user data that the router can receive on its serial port.

The router is considered a data terminal equipment (DTE) device, which sends or receives raw data that is converted to a signel for the WAN by the data communications equipment (DCE).
In our example, the CSU/DSU is considered an external CSU/DSU connects to the serial port and noramlly sits on top or beside your router.

It is possible to install an internal CSU/DSU module into your router and then connect the WAN link into that module.

#### Back-to-Back Serial Connection

You can also use the serial ports to create back-to-back connection between two routers, which requires a back-to-back serial cable.

Connecting two routers using a back-to-back serial cable enables you to simulate a WAN link in a test environment.

### Working with Cisco Hardware

#### Understainding Transceiver Modules

Transeiver modules are an important feature of Cisco devices today.

Instead of hardwiring a Cisco device for a specific type of interface, Cisco installs transceiver ports in some of its devices so that you can purchase a transceiver module with the port type for the cabling you desire.
For example, instead of requiring that you plug an RJ-45 port into a device for a gigabit interface, your Cisco device may include a transeiver port, so you can purchase a transceiver module that already contains an RJ-45 port on it.
This gives you flexibility in that the Cisco device is not hard-coded for one specific type of interface. Then, later, if you decide that you need to connect a fiber-optic cable to the device, you simply purchase that transceiver type and insert it into the transceiver port on the Cisco device.

Installing a tranceiver module is simple: slide the module into an SFP port on the Cisco device and lock it in place with the clamp.

**example transceiver types**

| OEM Part Number | Transfer Rate | Media Type        |
| --------------- | ------------- | ----------------- |
| GLC-T           | 1 Gbps        | UTP               |
| GLC-SX-MM       | 1 Gbps        | Multimode fiber   |
| GLC-LM-SM       | 1 Gbps        | Single moe fiber  |
| SFP-10G-SR-S    | 10 Gbps       | Multimode fiber   |
| SFP-10G-LR-S    | 10 Gbps       | Single mode fiber |
| QSFP-40G-SR-S   | 40 Gbps       | Multimode fiber   |
| QSFP-40G-LR-W   | 40 Gbps       | Single mode fiber |

#### Installing and Replacing Hardware

After you purchase a Cisco device, you will need to install the device in a rack located in a server room or communications closet.

Following are some common guidelines regarding installing your Cisco device:
* Ensure that the device is installed in the rack in a manner that enables you to see the front panel LEDs on the device and that you have access to all the ports.
* Ensure that the power cable can reach the device where it is being installed, and ensure that the network cabling is away from sources of electrical noise such as power lines and fluorescent lights.
* Ensure that there is adequate space around the Cisco device so that airflow through the vents is unrestricted.
* Ensure that cable lengths do not exceed the masium distance based on their specification. For example, twisted pair cabling has a maximum distance of 100m
* Ensure that the temperature around the device does not exceed 45 celcious.

After you remove the device from the box, attach the mounting brackets so that the device can be secured into the communications rack.
Using a Phillips screwdriver, screw the mounting brackets to the side of the device and then secure the device into the rack.

#### Installing and Replacing Modules

Some common examples of modules that you may install on a router

* **WIC-1T**
	* This WAN interface card with a DB-60 port provides a single serial port used to connect to the WAN environment.
* **WIC 1DSU/T1**
	* This WIC card with a single RJ-45 port is an internal CSU/DSU card that is used to connect to a T1 line.
* **WIC 2A/S**
	* This WIC module, with two V.35 serial connectors, enables connectivity to the WAN environment.

Remember that a label on the metal plate of each WLC card lists the card type.
Each type of module is supported by specific devices and has minimum IOS version that are required in order for the module to be recognized.
For example, the WIC 1DSU/T1 module is not recognized in my Cisco 1921 router because my router needs an HWIC version of the module.

The *High-Speed WAN Interface Card (HWIC)* is a newer version of the Cisco WIC card that supports higher speeds and better throughput.

After installing your new hardware modules, power on your cisco device and they verify the modules are dtected by usint the *show inventory* command.

```

```

When looking at this output, you can also see information about the WIC cards, below the device information, that are installed in the slots of the device.

#### Loopback Plugs

A loopback plug can be connected to a port to verify that the port is able to send and receive a signal without the signel leaving the system.

Loopback plugs are available for different types of interfaces such as an RJ-45 Ethernet interface, a T1 link, and a 56K link.
To loopback plug is a specially designed connector that has the transmit pins of the connector specially designed connector that has the transmit pins of the connector (pins 1 and 2 for UTP cabling) connected to the bidirectional pins on the same connector (pins 4 and 5 for UTP cabling).

Make your own T1 loopback plug:

1. Cut a small section of Ethernet cable (about 3 or 4 inches).
2. Remove the outer jacket of the cable
3. Position the RJ-45 connector clip away from you. The left side is pin 1 and the right side is pin 8 in the connector.
4. Using the orange wire color (it could be any wire), slide one end of the wire into pin 1 of the RJ-45 connector, and then bend the wire to connect the other end of the wire into pin 4 of the connector.
5. Using the blow wire color (it could be any wire), slide one end of the wire into pin2 of the RJ-45 connector, and then bend the wire and connect the other end of the wire into pin 5 of the connector.
6. With the wires in place, put the RJ-45 connector into the crimper and squeeze to crimp the wire.

### Types of Cisco Device Cables

### Console Calbe

![[Pasted image 20251008152411.png]]

The console cable is typically a light-blue cable that has a serial port (RS-232) connector on one end and an RJ-45 connector on the opposite end.

This cable is used to connect your computer to the Cisco device so you can locally configure the device.

### Ethernet Cable

![[Pasted image 20251008152702.png]]

You will use a Ethernet cable to connect the workstation to the switch or to connect the router to the switch.
You may also need crossover cables to connect similar devices, such as two switches.

### Serial Cable

![[Pasted image 20251008152824.png]]

Use a back-to-back serial cable to connect two routers using the routers' serial ports.
These are a number of different types of serial ports, so make sure you have the corret types of cables for those ports.

### Switch Stack Cable

**StackWise Cable**
![[Pasted image 20251008153046.png]]

Many of the enterprise-level switches support the StackWise feature, which enables you to connect the switches together as a manageable unit so you can centrally configure all switches from a single point.

### Exercies 6-1: Identifying Cisco Device Components

---

## Understanding Memory Types

### Read-Only Memory (ROM)

The software in ROM cannot be changed unless you actually swap out the ROM chip on your Cisco device.
ROM is nonvolatile meaning that when you turn off your device, the contents of ROM are not erased. ROM contains the firmware necessary to boot up your router and typically has the following three components:
* **Power-on self-test (POST)**
	* Performs test on the device's hardware components
* **Bootstrap program**
	* Brings the router up and determines how the IOS image and configuration files will be found and loaded.
* **ROM Monitor (ROMMON)**
	* A mini-OS that enables you to perform low-level testing and troubleshooting; for instance, ROMMON is used during the password recovery procedure.
	* To abort the router's normal bootup procedure of loading IOS, press ctrl-break to enter ROMMON mode.
	* The prompt in ROMMON mode is either > or rommon >, depending on the router model.

### Flash Memory

![[Pasted image 20251008153717.png]]

Flash is a form of nonvolatile memory, like ROM, meaning that when you turn the router off, the information stored in flash is not lost.

Routers store their IOS image in flash, but other information can also be stored here, such as a secondary configuration file.

Note that some lower-end Cisco routers actually run the IOS directly from flash (not RAM).
Flash is slower than RAM, a fact that can create performance issues.

### Volatile RAM (VRAM)

Volatile RAM (VRAM) on a Cisco device is like RAM in your computer in the sense that it loses its contents when you shut down the system down.

On a router, volative RAM, sometimes just referred to as RAM, contains the routing IOS image, the active configuration file (known as running config), any tables (including routing, ARP, and other tables), and internal buffers for temporaily storing information such as interface input and output buffers and logging messages.

When you turn off your router, everything in RAM is erased, including the items mentioned, such as your running config.

### NonVolatile RAM (NVRAM)

NVRAM is like flash in that itc contents are not erased when you turn off your router.
It is slightly different, through, in that it uses a battery to maintain the information when the Cisco device is turned off. 

Routers (and switdhes) are use NVRAM to store the configuration files, including the startup config, which is applied to the device during bootup after the IOS is loaded.

### Exercise 6-2: Identifying Memory Types

| Term            | Desc                                    |
| --------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| Flash memory    | Contains the IOS image files            |
| Volatile RAM    | Contains the running configuration file |
| ROM             | Contains bootstrap and ROMMON programs  |
| Nonvolatile RAM | Contains startup configuraiton file     |

---

## Administering the Cisco Device

### Using the CLI

The first and most often used method of administrating a Cisco device is to use the command line interface (CLI).

You can use the CLI for local or remote administration. With local administration, you have connected your laptop to the console port of the device and will use the CLI to administer the device.
The term "local" here means that you are in close physical proximity to the device and can connect to the console port.

After the device has been configured and has an assigned IP address, you can remotely administer the device from a workstation connected to the network to telnet or SSH into the device from another part of the network.

### Web-based Tools

With some Cisco devices, such as some switches and wireless access points, you can use a web interface to make configuration changes to the device.

---

## Starting the Cisco Device

### Boot Process

1. The router loads and runs POS (located in ROM), testing its hardware components, including memory and interfaces.
2. The bootstrap program is loaded and executed.
3. the configuration register is checked to determine how to boot up (where to find the IOS image and configuration file).
4. The bootstrap program finds and loads an IOS image. Possible locations of IOS images include flash or a TFTP server.
5. Once the IOS is loaded, the IOS attempts to find and load a configuration file, which is noramlly stored in NVRAM. If the IOS cannot find a configuration file, it starts up the System Configuration Dialog.
6. After the configuration is loaded, you are presented with the CLI (remember that the first mode you are placed into is user EXEC mode).

### Bootstrap Program

As you saw in the bootup code example, the bootstrap program found the IOS and loaded it.
The bootstrap program goes through the following steps when trying to locate and load the IOS image:

1. It examines the configuration register value.
	* This value is a set of four hexadecimal digits.
	* The last digit affects the bootup process.
	* If the last digit is between 0x2 and 0xF, the router proceeds to hte next step.
	* Otherwise, the router uses the values to determine how it should proceed.

**Fourth Hex Character Configuration Register Values**

2. It examines the configuration file in NVRAM for *boot system* commands, which tell the bootstrap program where to find the IOS.
3. If no *boot system* commands are found in the configuration file in NVRAM, it uses the first valid IOS image found in flash.
4. If no valid IOS images are in flash, it generates a TFTP local broadcast to loate a TFTP server (this is called *netboot* and is not recommended, because it is very slow and not very reliable for large IOS images).
5. If no TFTP server is found, it loads the Mini-IOS in ROM (RXBOOT mode).
6. If there is a Mini-IOS in ROM, it loads the Mini-IOS and enters RXBOOT mode; otherwiser, the router either retries to find and IOS image or loads ROMMON and goes into ROMMON mode.

For step 2 of the bootup process, you can use the following *boot system* commands to influence the order that the bootstrap program should use when trying to locate the IOS image:

```
Router(config)# boot system flash NAME_OF_IOS_FILE_IN_FLASH
Router(config)# boot system tftp IOS_IMAGE_NAME IP_ADDR_OF_SERVER
Router(config)# boot system rom
```

> The order in which you enter the boot system commands is important, since the bootstrap program process them in the order in which you configure them.
> Once the program finds an IOS image, it does not process any more boot system commands in the configuration file.

The `boot system flash` command tells the bootstrap program to load the specified IOS filename in flash when booting up.
Note that, by default, the bootstrap program loads the *first* valid IOS image in flash.

This commands tells the bootstrap program to laod an image that's different from the first one.
This might be necessary if you perform an upgrade and you have two IOS images in flash (the old one and new one).
By default, the old one still loads first (because it appears first in flash) unless you override this behavior with the `boot system flash` command or delete the old IOS flash image.

You can also have the bootstrap program load the IOS from a TFTP server, but this is not recommended for large images, since the image is downladed via the UDP, which is slow. And last, you can tell the bootstrap program to load the Mini-IOS in ROM with the `boot system rom` command.

To remove any of these commands, just preface then with the `no` parameter.

### System Configuration Dialog

When a router boots up, runs its hardware diagnostics, and loads IOS software, the IOS then attempts to find a configuration file in NVRAM.

If it can't find a configuration file to load, the IOS runs the System Configuration Dialog, commonly referred to as *Setup* mode, which is a script that prompts you for configuration information.

The purpose of this script is to ask you questions that will enable you to set up a basic configuration on your router: It is noe intended as a full-functioning configuration too.
In other words, the scrip doesn't have the ability to perform all the router's configuration tasks.
Instead, it is used by novices who are not that comfortable with the IOS CLI.
Once you become familiar with the CLI and many of the commands on the router, you'll probably never use this script again.

#### Running the System Configuration Dialog

One way to access the System Configuration Dialog is to boot up a router without a configuration in NVRAM.
The second way is to use the `setup` command.

```
R1#setup


         --- System Configuration Dialog ---

Continue with configuration dialog? [yes/no]: yes

At any point you may enter a question mark '?' for help.
Use ctrl-c to abort configuration dialog at any prompt.
Default settings are in square brackets '[]'.


Basic management setup configures only enough connectivity
for management of the system, extended setup will ask you
to configure each interface on the system

Would you like to enter basic management setup? [yes/no]: yes
Configuring global parameters:

  Enter host name [R1]:

  The enable secret is a password used to protect access to
  privileged EXEC and configuration modes. This password, after
  entered, becomes encrypted in the configuration.
  Enter enable secret:
% No defaulting allowed
  Enter enable secret: secret

  The enable password is used when you do not specify an
  enable secret password, with some older software versions, and
  some boot images.
  Enter enable password: secret
% Please choose a password that is different from the enable secret
  Enter enable password: password

  The virtual terminal password is used to protect
  access to the router over a network interface.
  Enter virtual terminal password: virtpass
  Configure SNMP Network Management? [no]:

Current interface summary

Interface                  IP-Address      OK? Method Status                Protocol
FastEthernet0/0            unassigned      YES unset  administratively down down
FastEthernet1/0            unassigned      YES unset  administratively down down

Enter interface name used to connect to the
management network from the above interface summary:
% No defaulting allowed

Enter interface name used to connect to the
management network from the above interface summary: F0/0
Invalid interface


Enter interface name used to connect to the
management network from the above interface summary: FastEthernet0/0

Configuring interface FastEthernet0/0:
  Use the 100 Base-TX (RJ-45) connector? [yes]: yes
  Operate in full-duplex mode? [no]:
  Configure IP on this interface? [no]:

The following configuration command script was created:

hostname R1
enable secret 5 $1$89NG$XUe.9lXmZ3HIPfSFQqoqt1
enable password password

end


[0] Go to the IOS command prompt without saving this config.
[1] Return back to the setup without saving this config.
[2] Save this configuration to nvram and exit.

Enter your selection [2]:
Building configuration...
[OK]
Use the enabled mode 'configure' command to modify this configuration.
```

Information included in brackets indicates the default value. If you press enter, the value in the brackets is used.

One problem with this script is that if you make a mistake, you can't go back to the preceding question.
Instead, you must use the `ctrl-c` break sequence to abort the script and start over.

#### Status and Global Configuration Information

At the beginning of the script, you are asked whether or not you want to continue.
If you answer *yes*, the script will continue; otherwise, if you answer *no*, the script is aborted and you are returned to privileged EXEC mode.

Next you are asked whether you want to see all of the interfaces on the router, the interfaces' IP addresses, and the status of the interfaces.

After the status information, you be shown the actual configuration.
The first part of the configuration deals with all configuration information for the router except for the interfaces, which is the second part.
In this part of the cconfiguration, you are asked for things such as the privileged EXEC password, virtual type termial (VTY) password (telnet and SSH), which network protocols you wnat to activate globally, and other global configuration information.

> Note that you are prompted for two privileged EXEC passwords in the script: `enable secret` and `enable password`.
> Even through you would normally configure only one, the script requires you to enter both and also requires that both passwords be different.
> You will need to enter Privileged EXEC mode using the secret when the secret is set.

#### Protocol and Interface Configuration Information

After configuring the global information for the router, you are then led through questions about which interfaces you want to use and how they should be configured.

The script is smart enough to ask configuration questions based on how you answered the global questions.
As an example, if you active IP, the script asks you for each activated interface, wheter you want the interface to process IP, and, if yes, the IP addressing information for the interface.

#### Exiting Setup Mode

After you answer all of the script's configuration questions, you are shown the router configuration the script created using your answers to the script's questions.

Note that the IOS hasn't yet activated the configuration file.
Examine the configuration closely and then make one of the three choices.

**Options at the End of the System Configuration Dialog**

| Option | Desc                                                                                                      |
| ------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 0      | Discard the script's configuraiton and return to privileged EXEC mode                                     |
| 1      | Return to the beginning of the script.                                                                    |
| 2      | Activate the script's configuration, save the configuration to NVRAM, and return to privileged EXEC mode. |

Also, if you enter `1` as your option, when the script starts over again, the information that you previously entered appears in brackets and will be the default values when you press the enter key on an empty line.

## Service-Related Tasks for Technicians

### Using a Text Editor

VIM

### Launching a Command Prompt

When troubleshooting connectivity problems, you may need to launch a command prompt and run a few of the troubleshooting commands from there.

**Some example troubleshooting commands:**
* **`ping`**
	* `ping <ip_addr>`
	* verify that a device or system is up and running on the network
* **`traceroute`**
	* `traceroute <ip_addr>`
	* verify the pathway that a packet takes to reach the destination.
* **`nslookup`**
	* `nslookup <dns_name>`
	* send a query to DNS and find out the IP address of a *fully qualified domain name (FQDN).*
* **`arp`**
	* `arp -a`
	* view the ARP cache of the system
* **`pathping`**
	* `pathping <dns_name>`
	* combines the `ping` and `traceroute` commands.

### Configuring NIC Settings

As a service technician, you may need to configure the TCP/IP settings on your technician laptop to gain access to the customer network when connecting the Ethernet port on your laptop to the Cisco equipment, typically a switch.

To connect your laptop to the customer network, connect a straight-through Ethernet cable to the Ethernet port on your laptop to a port on the Cisco switch.
You will then need to verify and possibly configure the TCP/IP settings to gain access to the network.

To verify your IP address settings, use the `ipconfig` command.

### Connecting to the Console Port

If you want to connect to the Cisco device locally without needing an IP address on your laptop, you can connect to the console port of the Cisco device using a console cable, also known as a rollover cable.

To connect to the console port, you connect the console cable to the serial port on your laptop, or use a serial-to-USB adapter if you do not have a serial port on the laptop.

Once you have connected the console cable to the Cisco device and your laptop, you are ready to launch terminal software to administer the device.

### Using Terminal Emulator Software

KITTY (XORG, WAYLAND)
TTY0

### Connect and Verify the Status of the Device Interface

You have connected a computer to interface 5 on the switch and you want to verify that the interface is working okay.

**verify your interfaces**
* **`show ip interface brief`**
	* get a list of all of the interfaces on the device and take a quick look at their statuses.
	* You can determine whether the interface is up and running and view the IP address assigned to the interface.
* **`show interfaces`**
	* To view a list of all the interfaces and detailed specifications on the interfaces.
* **`show interafces E0/0`**
	* Use this command to view the details of a specific interface.
* **`show controllers s0/3/0`**
	* Use the `show controllers` command on serial interfaces to view information such as the DCE and DTE details.

## Quick Review

### Working with Cisco Devices and Software

* Cisco offers several product lines.
* The model and serial number are typically located on a sticker on the back of the Cisco device.
* The console port is used for local administration.
* The auxiliary port is used to connect a modem to the router as a backup administration line
* Each LAN port is identifies by the type of port and an index number, such as FE0/0 for the first Fast Ethernet port in slot 0 or G0/3 as the third Gigabit port in slot 0.

### Understanding Memory Types

* ROM memory stores the POST routines, the bootstrap program, and the ROMMON program used when troubleshooting boot issues.
* Flash memory stores the IOS images
* Volatile RAM stores the running configuration and different tables in RAM, such as the routing table.
* Nonvolatile memory stores the startup config.

### Administering the Cisco Device

* You can locally administer the Cisco device by connecting to the console port of the device using a console cable.
* You can remotely connect to the device over the network by using telnet or SSH to perform administration on a device
* On some devices, such as wireless access points, you can use a web interface for administration.

### Starting the Cisco Device

* When you boot the Cisco device, the POST runs first, and then the bootstrap program is loaded, which locates the IOS image to load. Finally, the startup configuration is applied after the IOS is loaded.
* If there is no startup configufation, the device will prompt you to run the System Configuration Dialog, which is wizard-style interface that prompts you for the configuration information.
* Use the `boot system` command to specify which IOS image to boot from.

#### Service-Related Tasks for Technicians

* As a service technician, you must know how to connect to a Cisco device via the console port to perform local administration.
* Know how to use programs on your laptop, such as a text editor and terminal emulation software, to connect to the Cisco device.
* Know common troubleshooting commands such as `ping`, `ipconfig`, `ifconfig` and `traceroute` to troubleshoot communication issues.
