## Configuring TCP/IP

### IP Address

The IP address is a 32-bit value that uniquely identifies the system on the network (or the Internet).

The IP address is divided into four numbers, with each number separated by a period (for example, 192.168.1.15). Each of the four numbers is made up of 8 bits, and there are four numbers of 8 bits each, equaling 32 bits.

Each of the 8-bit values called an *octect*. There are four octects in an IP address.
The four octets in an IP address are divided into two parts: a network ID and a host ID.

The network ID portion of the IP address is a unique number that identifies the particular network.
The host ID portion is a unique number that identifies the computer or device on that network.

The subnet mask determines the number of bits that make up the network ID and the number of bits that make up the host ID.

### Subnet Mask

The subnet mask is used by TCP/IP to determine whether a host is on a local or remote network.
When a 255 is used in an octet, then the corresponding octet (the octet in the same position) in the IP address represents the network ID.
So, if my IP address is 192.168.1.15 and my subnet mask is 255.255.255.0, the first three octets of the subnet mask would represent the network ID (192.168.1) and the last octet (0) would represent the host ID (15).

If a subnet mask is 255.0.0.0, it would mean that the first octet of the IP address (192 in our example) is used as the network ID portion, while the last three octets (168.1.15) are the host ID portion of the IP address.

When a system such as 192.168.1.15 with a subnet mask of 255.255.255.0 sends a piece of data to system 192.168.45.10, the sending system first needs to determine whether the target computer exist on the same network or not.
It does this by comparing the network IDs.
If the network IDs are the same, then both systems exist on the same network and one system can send to the other without the use of a router.
If the systems exist on different networks, the data will need to be passed to the router so that the router can send the data to the other network.

### Exercise 4-1: Identifying Remote Systems

Determine whether two systems exist on the same network or on separate networks.

![[Pasted image 20251005152423.png]]

different (network ID: 12, network ID: 14)
different (network ID: 131.107, network ID: 131.108)
same (network ID: 198.45.23, network ID: 198.45.23)
different (network ID: 26, network ID: 28)
same (network ID: 176.34, network ID: 176.34)

### Default Gateway

When your system wants to send data to another system on the network, it looks at its ow network ID and compares that to the destination system's network ID.

If it appears that both have the same network ID, the data is sent directly from your system to the destination system.
If the two systems are on different networks, your system must pass the data to the router so that the router can send the data to the destination system's router.

How dose your system know where the router is? The default gateway is the IP address of the router that will be used to send data from your network to another network.

### Understanding Binary

```

```

Notice that there are four sets of 8 bits (1 or 0), which make up the 32 bits (8 x 4 sets) of an IP address.

| Bit   | 8   | 7   | 6   | 5   | 4   | 3   | 2   | 1   |
| ----- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |

### Address Classes

Every IP address belongs to a distinct *address class*.

The Internet community defined these classes to acoomodate networks of various sizes. The class to which the IP address belongs initially determines the network ID and host ID portions of the address, along with the number of hosts that are supported on that network.

The different calss addresses are class A, class B, Class C, and class E

| class | first octet | subnet mask   | # of hosts per network |
| ----- | ----------- | ------------- | ---------------------- |
| A     | 1-127       | 255.0.0.0     | 16,777,214             |
| B     | 128-191     | 255.255.0.0   | 65,534                 |
| C     | 192-223     | 255.255.255.0 | 254                    |

#### Class A Addresses

A class A address has a default subnet mask of 255.0.0.0, which means that first octet is the network ID and the last three octets represent the host ID portion of the address.

each octet can contain 256 possible values (0-255), so a class A address supports 16,777,216 hosts on the network (256 x 256 x 256).
Actually there are only 16,777,214 valid addresses to use on systems, because there are two addresses on each IP network you are not allowed to assign to systems because they are reserved.

There are the address with all host bits set to 0s (the network ID) and all host bits set to 1s (the broadcast address). So with a class A address, you will not be able to assign n.0.0.0 or n.255.255.255 to any hosts on the network.

#### Class B Addresses

Class B addresses have a default subnet mask of 255.255.0.0, which means that the first two octets are the network ID and the last two octets are the host ID portion of the address.

#### Class C Addresses

Class C addresses have a subnet mask of 255.255.255.0, which means that the first three octets are the network ID and the last octet is the host ID.

#### Class D Addresses

Class D addresses are used for special types of applications on the network (multicasting applications).

Multicasting applications send data to a number of systems at the same time by sending data to the multicast address, and any system that has  registered with that address will receive the data.

Because class D addresses are used for multicast addresses, you will not be assigning them specifically to hosts on the network for normal network communication.

Class D addresses have a value on the first octet that ranges from 224 to 239.
With that many ranges, class D has the potential for 268,435,456 unique mulitcast groups that users can subscribe to from a multicast application.

#### Class E Addresses

They were designed for experimental purposes only, so you will never see a class E address on a network.
Class E addresses have a first octet with a value between 240 and 247.

### Exercise 4-4: Identifying Address Classes

| IP addr         | Subnet Mask   | Address Class |
| --------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| 27.56.89.234    | 255.0.0.0     | A             |
| 196.79.123.56   | 255.255.255.0 | C             |
| 130.49.34.23    | 255.255.0.0   | B             |
| 109.189.109.200 | 255.0.0.0     | A             |
| 189.90.23.100   | 255.255.0.0   | B             |
| 126.34.100.12   | 255.0.0.0     | A             |
| 14.198.120.100  | 255.0.0.0     | A             |

#### Rules for Defining Classes

* **Class A**
	* 00000001 to 01111111
	* 1 to 127
	* you cannot have an address of 00000000, so this range starts at 1
* **Class B**
	* 10000000 to 10111111
	* 128 to 191
* **Class C**
	* 11000000 to 11011111
	* 192 to 223
* **Class D**
	* 11100000 to 11101111
	* 224 to 239
* **Class E**
	* 11110000 to 11110111
	* 240 to 247

### Loopback Address

You are not allowed to have a host assined an IP address that has a value of 127 in the first octet.
This is because the class A address range of 127 has been reserved for the loopback address.

The loopback address is used to refer to the local system, also known as the *localhost*.
If you want to verify that the TCP/IP software has initialized on the local system even though you may not have an IP address, you can ping the loopback address, which is typically referred to as 127.0.0.1

### Private Addresses

A private address can be assigned to a system but cannot be used for any kind of Internet connectivity.
Private addresses are *notroutable* on the Internet, so any system using them will not be able to route data across the Internet.

**private address range**

* 10.0.0.0 - 10.255.255.255
* 172.16.0.0 - 172.31.255.255
* 192.168.0.0 - 192.168.255.255

Due to the growth of the Internet, it became impossible for every device that needed Internet access to use a public IP address as were running out of addresses.
So private addresses are used inside networks because they are not seen by other systems on the Internet; we use a Network Address Translation (NAT) device to translate the private address to a public address.

#### APIPA

Systems today support the *Automatic Private IP Addressing (APIPA)* feature.

When a client boots up and cannot contact a DHCP server, the client will configure itself automatically with a 169.254.x.y address.
If there is something wrong with the DHCP server and none of the system on the network can obtain an address, all of the clients will assign themselves an address within the 169.254 address range and will then be able to communicate with one another (on same network).

APIPA does not assign a default gateway, so you will be unable to access resources on a remote network and the Internet.
When troubleshooting to determine why a machine cannot communicate on the network, watch for systems that have the 169.254.x.y address range, because this indicates that they could not find a DHCP server.

### Invalid IP Addresses for Hosts

A few IP addresses cannot be assigned to hosts on the network.

The first is an address that has all bits set to 0s in the host ID, which signifies the network ID of the network.
The second is an address that has all bits set to 1s in the host ID, which signifies the broadcast address for the network.

So, for example, in the Class C network 200.158.157.x, the address 200.158.157.0 (the network ID) and 200.158.157.255 (the broadcast address) are not available to assign to hosts on the network, reducing the available number of hosts from 256 to 254.

Another illegal address is any system that has the first octet of 127; remember that this is reserved as the loopback address, and you will not able to assign the address to any host.

**Summarize illegal address**
* **127**
	* reserved for loopback
* **All host bits set to 0**
	* Network ID
* **All host bits set to 1**
	* Broadcast address
* **A duplicate address**
	* This result in a duplicate IP address error

Not being able to route data across the Internet when using these address will not pose a problem, because, realistically, these private address will be sitting behind a NAT server that will translate the private address to a public address that can be routed on the Internet.

### Exercise 4-5: Understanding Valid Addresses

| class | range bin         | range dec | subnet mask   |
| ----- | ----------------- | --------- | ------------- |
| A     | 00000001-01111111 | 1-127     | 255.0.0.0     |
| B     | 10000000-10111111 | 128-191   | 255.255.0.0   |
| C     | 11000000-11011111 | 192-223   | 255.255.255.0 |

| Addr           | Valid? | DESC                                               |
| -------------- | ------ | -------------------------------------------------- |
| 10.0.40.10     | no     | private address                                    |
| 127.54.67.89   | no     | loopback addr                                      |
| 131.107.34.0   | yes    | Class B, Subnet mask 255.255.0.0                   |
| 45.1.2.0.0     | yes    | Class A, Subnet mask 255.0.0.0                     |
| 216.83.11.255  | no     | Class C, Subnet mask 255.255.255.0, Broadcast Addr |
| 63.256.4.78    | yes    | Class A, Subnet mask 255.0.0.0                     |
| 200.67.34.0    | no     | Class C, Subnet mask 255.255.255.0, Network ID     |
| 131.107.23.255 | yes    | Class B, Subnet mask 255.255.0.0                   |

### Addressing Schemes

On a netwok, data can be sent to the destination in several different ways: data can be sent to a unicast address, a broadcast address, or a multicast address.

* **Unicast**
	* Sends information to one system.
	* With IP, this is accomplished by sending data to the IP address of the intended destination system.
* **Broadcast**
	* Sends information to all systems on the network.
	* Data is destined for all systems is sent by using the broadcast address for the network.
* **Multicast**
	* Sends information to a selected groups of systems.
	* Typically, this is accomplished by having the systems subscribe to a multicast address.
	* Any data that is sent to the multicast address is then received by all systems subscribed to the address.
	* Most multicast address start with 224.x.y.z and are considered class D addresses.

### TCP/IP Ports

An application or process uses a TCP/IP port as an identifier for that application/process running on a system.
When you send data from one computer to another, you send data to the port used by that application.

For example, when you type the IP address of a web site in your web browser, the web browser connects to the web server (or web applicatoin) running at that system by sending data to port 80, which is default port of a web server.
When the web server answers your request by sending the web page to your browser, because the browser is running on a particular port as well, the web server sends the page to the port of the web browser.

![[Pasted image 20251006082919.png]]

Server applications typically use low port numbers under 1024, whereas client applications usually run on port numbers greater than 1024.
There are three types of ports:
* **Well-known ports**
	* These port numbers are used by servers and range from 0 to 1023
* **Registered ports**
	* These ports assigned to certain applications or protocols.
	* Range from 1024 to 49151
* **Dynamic ports**
	* These ports used by applications temporarily
	* Range from 49152 to 65535.
	* They are called dynamic ports because many times, a port is selected at runtime by application and is different each time the program runs.

**Well-known ports**

Another term that you will hear a lot is *socket*, which is the endpoint of communication and is made up of three components: the IP address of the system, the port number of the application, and the protocol that is being used, either TCP or UDP.

```
Socket = IP ADDR + Port number + Protocol {TCP | UDP}
```

The socket is how data is sent from one system to another, or more accurately, from on application to another.

## Configuring IP Address settings

### Manual Configuration vs. DHCP

When configuring IP address settings on your workstations or network devices such as routers and switches, you can either manually configure the setting or dynamically assign addresses via DHCP.

#### Manual Configuration

Maual configuration of a workstation or device such as a router involves going into the configuration of the network interfaces manually inputting the IP address, subnet mask, and default gateway setting.

Manual configuration can be labor intensive, so we normally manuall configure only servers, routers and switches.
The client on the network obtain their IP address dynamically from the DHCP server.

#### Dynamic Configuration

Configuring IP addressing on a large TCP/IP-based network can be a nightmare, espeically if machines are moved frequently from one network to another.

DHCP can help with the workload of configuring systems on a network by assigning address to systems automatically on bootup.
The process of dynamically assigning IP addresses is managed via a DHCP server.
The DHCP server can be a separate device, a service running on a server, or a service loaded on your Cisco router.
The DHCP service is configured with a set of usable IP addresses, called a *scope*.

The scope can also include the subnet mask, IP addresses of the default gateway, DNS servers, and other neccessary addresses.
When a PC powers on and is configured to use a DHCP server, it uses the following steps to obtain an address:

1. **DHCP Discover**
	* The client sends out a DHCP Discover message, which is a broadcast request packet, looking for any DHCP services on the network.
2. **DHCP Offer**
	* The DHCP server responds with a DHCP Offer message containing an IP address that the client can lease.
3. **DHCP Request**
	* The client then accepts the offer by sending a DHCP Request message to the DHCP server for that address.
4. **DHCP Acknowledgement**
	* The DHCP server responds by sending a DHCP ACK message to the client confirming the client is leasing the address.
	* The DHCP ACK message also contains additional TCP/IP settings such as the lease time.
	* The DHCP server marks the IP address in its database as being in use so that it is not assigned again.

### Configuring TCP/IP on Systems

``` bash
ifconfig eth0 12.0.0.11 netmask 255.0.0.0
```

*Eth0* is the interface or network card you are modifying.
*12.0.0.11* is the IP address you want to use.
*netmask 255.0.0.0* is the subnet mask.

### Verify IP Address settings

Once you have configured your TCP/IP settings, it is a good idea to verify that the IP address settings have taken affect.

```bash
# view your TCP/IP settings
ifconfig
```

## Understanding the Pathway of Communication

**steps that occur when ComputerB sends data to ComputerD:**
![[Pasted image 20251006104311.png]]

1. The command `ping 13.0.0.10` is entered at ComputerB to invoke communication.
2. ComputerB compares its IP address and subnet mask against the IP address that being pinged to determine whether the system is on the same network. Because the network IDs are different, IP determines the systems are on different networks
	* This is actually done at the binary level with a process called ANDing
3. ComputerB retrives the default gateway settings from the TCP/IP settings, as that is the address it needs to send the data to in order to send data to a different network.
4. ComputerB then ARPs the IP address of the default gateway to obtain the MAC address of the default gateway.
5. The ARP reply message is returned to ComputerB with the MAC address of the default gateway.
6. ComputerB sends the data to the router with the following header information
```
Layer 2 Header:
	SRC  MAC: 2222.2222.2222
	DEST MAC: AAAA.5555.5555
Layer 3 Header:
	SRC  IP: 12.0.0.10
	DEST IP: 13.0.0.10
```
7. The router receives the layer 2 frame and then reads the layer 3 header to determine where the packet is headed.
	* The router sees that the packet is destined for 13.0.0.10, so it checks to see it has a route in the routing table.
	* It does, and it realized it just needs to send data out the 13.0.0.1 interface to reach the destination.
8. To send the data, the router needs to know the MAC address of 13.0.0.10, so it sends out an ARP request message.
9. The router receives the ARP reply containing the MAC address of Computer D.
10. The router sends the data to ComptuerD with the following header information:
```
Layer 2 Header:
	SRC  MAC: BBBB.6666.6666
	DEST MAC: 4444.4444.4444
Layer 3 Header:
	SRC  IP: 12.0.0.10
	DEST IP: 13.0.0.10
```

The important point here is to notice that the layer 2 header is modified each step along the way to move the frame to the next step.
But the layer 3 header is never modified, because it contains the network address to route the data to the correct network.

### Exercise 4-6: Analyzing the Pathway to Communication

![[Pasted image 20251006145222.png]]

Computer A to Computer D
SRC IP: 12.0.0.5
DEST IP: 14.0.0.15

1.  Looking at the diagram, record the layer 2 and layer 3 header information that the packet will have at the point circled with a 1.
Layer 2 Source Address: aaaa.aaaa.aaaa.aaaa
Layer 2 Destination Address: eeee.1111.1111
Layer 3 Source Address: 12.0.0.5
Layer 3 Destination Address: 14.0.0.15

Computer A sends data to router (VAN-R1, G0/0 interface)

2.  Looking at the diagram, record the layer 2 and layer 3 header information that the packet will have at the point circled with a 2.
Layer 2 Source Address: eeee.2222.2222
Layer 2 Destination Address: eeee.3333.3333
Layer 3 Source Address: 12.0.0.5
Layer 3 Destination Address: 14.0.0.15

Router sends data to another router (VAN-R1 to LA-R1)

3.  Looking at the diagram, record the layer 2 and layer 3 header information that the packet will have at the point circled with a 3.
Layer 2 Source Address: eeee.4444.4444
Layer 2 Destination Address: dddd.dddd.dddd
Layer 3 Source Address: 12.0.0.5
Layer 3 Destination Address: 14.0.0.15

Router(LA-R1) sends data to ComputerD

## Chapter Review

The IP address and subnet mask are the most important configuration settings and must be specified correctly in order to communicate on a TCP/IP-based network.
Next in importance is the default gateway, which specifies where to route packets if you are communicating outside the local network.

The DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol) automatically configured a workstation with the correct TCP/IP settings, relieving you of the burden of manually configuring every workstation.

## Quick Review

### TCP/IP Fundamentals

* TCP/IP addresses are 32-bit addresses.
* The IP address is a unique value assigned to the system that identifies the system on the network.
* The subnet mask is used to determine the network ID portion of an IP address.
* The network ID is used to determine whether or not the destination system exist on the same network.
* The host ID identifies the system within the network
* The default gateway refers to the IP address of the router and is used to send data from the local network.

### TCP/IP Addressing

* **Class A**
	* 00000001 to 01111111
	* 1 to 127
	* you cannot have an address of 00000000, so this range starts at 1
* **Class B**
	* 10000000 to 10111111
	* 128 to 191
* **Class C**
	* 11000000 to 11011111
	* 192 to 223
* **Class D**
	* 11100000 to 11101111
	* 224 to 239
	* used for multicasting
* **Class E**
	* 11110000 to 11110111
	* 240 to 247

An application or process uses a TCP/IP port to communicate between client and server computers.
