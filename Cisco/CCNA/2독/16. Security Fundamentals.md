## Understanding Threats and Attack Types

### Fundamentals of Security

#### Confidentiality

The first goal of information security is to keep information confidential, which means not allowing unauthorized individuals to access the information.
You can use a number of methods to maintain confidentiality:

* You can configure permissions on files and/or folders to block unauthorized individuals from accessing these files and/or folders.
* You can encrypt the data in storage so that only people with the decryption key can gain access to the data. This is known as *encrypt-in-storage*.
* You can encrypt the data as it travels across the network or Internet. This is known as *encrypt-in-transit*.

#### Integrity

Integrity deals with being able to ensure the integrity of the data that is being read.

If, for example, an employee stores a file on the server and the next month access that file, how does he know that the file has not been tampered with or altered? You can use technologies that offer integrity services to identify whether the file has been altered.

A common technique to prove integrity is *hashing*. With hashing, the data is run through a hasing algorithm to generate an answer (known as a *hash value*). This hash value is then stored for reference at a later time.
The next time you read the file, you run the file through the same hashing algorithm to generate a new hash value. You then compare the two hash values: if the two hash value are the same, the file has not been altered.

Common examples of hashing algorithms are Message Digest 5 (MD5) and Secure Hashing Algorithm 1 (SHA-1) and 256 (SHA-256).

#### Availability

* **Backups**
	* we can restore the data from the backups.
* **RAID**
	* If a drive fails, still be able to access the data
* **Clustering**
	* Servers are placed in a highly available cluster, so that if one server fails, the other server can handle the workload.
* **FHRP**
	* You can configure your Cisco router in a first hop redundancy protocol (FHRP) topology, so that if a router fails, another router can take over and can still gain Interent or WAN access.

### Vulnerabilities and Exploits

* **Threat**
	* An action that exposes a compromise to confidentialtiy, integrity, or the availability of an asset.
	* deinal-of-serveice (DoS) attacks (violate availability) or an attaker hacking a database and retrieving credit card numbers (violate confidentiality).
* **Threat actor**
	* The person or group causing the threat to occur
	* Common examples are hackers and disgruntled employees.
* **Vulnerability**
	* A weakness in a product that could enable someone to bypass security of the product and gain access to or cause damage to the system.
* **Exploit**
	* An activity that takes advantage of a system or software vulnerability to compromise security.
* **Mitigation technique**
	* The method used to reduce the likelihood or impact of a threat or to remote it entirely.
	* For example, to mitigate a DoS attack, we could create multiple servers in a highly available solution. Or to mitigate a potential attacker's access to credit card numbers, we could encrypt the credit card numbers included in the database.

### Common Vulnerabilities

* **Unnecessary running services**
	* The more software running on a system, the more likely vulnerabilities exist that the hacker can use to gain access to it.
* **Open ports**
	* TCP or UDP port open on the system is an invitation for a hacker to gain access to the system.
	* Close any open ports on the system that are not needed, and use a firewall to block access to ports that must remain open.
* **Unpatched systems**
	* Be sure keep your system up-to-date with patches and security fixes. That way, any software on the system is less likely to have vulnerabilities that a hacker can exploit.
* **Unencrypted channels**
	* Ensure that any communication channels between systems are encrypted as must as possible.
* **Clear-text credentials**
	* Ensure that the authentication protocols being used are encrypting the passwords when users are authenticating to the systems.
* **Unsecure protocols**
	* telnet, TTHP, FTP, TFTP, SNMPv1 and SNMPv2 send traffic in unencrypted format.
	* Be sure to investigate each protocol used on the network; if it is not encrypting communication, find a secure replacement for that protocol.

### Malicious Software

Malicious software is any software that is designed to harm a system, and it comes in many forms.

* **Virus**
	* The traditional virus is attached to a file, so that when you open the file, the virus is activated and infects your system.
* **Worm virus**
	* A worm virus is self-replicating virus, which means that it can infect your system without you opening a file.
* **Trojan virus**
	* A Trojan virus is a program that you are tricked into installing because you believe the application does something useful; in reality, however, the program is virus that infects your system.
	* Typically modifes your system by opening a TCP/IP port, which allows a hacker to connect to the system and take control of it.
* **Spyware**
	* Monitors and collects information about you and your Internet surfing habits.
	* It can make changes to your system through browser redirection (sending you to a different web page) or slow down your network connection.
* **Adware**
	* This software automatically loads advertisements on your screen, typically in the form of pop-up windows.
* **Logic bomb**
	* logic bomb waits until a particular condition is satisfied, such as a specific date, and then the virus perfroms its malicious purpose.
* **Keylogger**
	* A keylogger is either a piece of software or a hardware device installed on your system that is designed to capture all of your keystrokes in an attempt to learn your passwords and other information.
* **Spam**
	* Spam refers to unsolicited commercial e-mails.
	* These e-mail messages typically are mass mailed, and their purpose is to convince you to purchase their products or services.
* **Ransomware**
	* This malicious software takes control of your system and does not give control back until you pay a fee.
	* encrypts your device, and you must pay a fee to get the encryption key.

### Mitigating Attacks

Mitigation techniques that actions you can take to reduce or eliminate threats.

**common mitigation techniques**

* *Patch systems*
	* The first step you can take to protect your systems is to ensure that you have a patch management strategy in place.
	* Make sure that you keep all systems up-to-date with patches, because they remove known valnerabilities from your system.
* *Encrypt network traffic*
	* To protect your data from prying eyes, ensure that you are encrypting all network communication.
* *Encrypt data stored on mobile devices*
	* Ensure that you are encrypting data is stored on mobile devices.
* *Install antivirus software*
* *Use string passwords*
* *Educate empolyees*
* *Run hashing algorithms*

### Attack Types

#### Social Engineering Attacks

With a social engineering attack, the attacker compromises the network or system through social interaction with an individual through an e-mail message or phone call, tricking the victim into divulging information that can be used to compromise security.

The information that the victim divulges to the hacker would most likely be used in a subsequent attack to gain unauthorized access to a ssystem or network.

**Common social engineering attack senarios:**

* **Attacker impersonates administrator**
	* The attacker may call an employee and impersonate the company's network administrator.
	* The hacker will try to convince the employee to change his or her password or divulge password information so that the attacker can use the information to access the system.
* **Attacker impersonates user**
	* The attcker calls an unsuspecting network administrator and plays the role of a frustrated user who canno log on to the network.
	* The network administrator naturally helps the "user" by resetting his or her password and helping the person log on, which results in giving the attacker access to the system.
* **Attacker impersontaes vendor**
	* The attcker may e-mail a customer and pretent to be a vendor of a piece of software.
	* The attacker tries to convince the user to install an update, but the user doesn't realize the update is actually a Trojan virus that gives the attacker access to the system.

#### Phishing Attack

Phishing attack occurs when the hacker creates a fake web site that looks exactly like a popular web site, such as a site for a bank or online merchant.

The attacker sends an e-mail message trying to trick the user into clicking a link that leads to the fake site with his or her account information to log on to the real site, potentially gaining access to the user's account.

There are several forms of phishing attacks. *Spear phishing* is focused on a specific victim or group of victims. In general, phishing attacks are sent to ramdom e-mail addresses, but in spear phishing, the attcker poses as a known or trusted sender and targets specific individuals or groups.
A *whaling attack* is form of phishing attack that is targeted at company executives.

#### Network-Based Attacks

* **Eavesdropping attack**
	* Also known as *packet sniffing*
	* eavesdropping involves the use of a network monitoring tool known as a sniffer, which is used to capture and analyze network traffic.
	* If the traffic is not encrypted, the hacker could read confidential data, including usernames and passwords.
* **Spoofing**
	* In a spoof attack, the hacker modifies the source address of the packets he or she is sending so that the packet appears to be coming from someone else.
	* Spoofing is a common method to bypass access controls placed on switches, routers, or firewalls.
		* *MAC spoofing*
			* Involves altering the source MAC address of a packet.
			* It is common for an attacker to spoof the MAC address so that he can bypass the MAC filtering features on a wireless network or attempt to bypass the port security features of a switch
		* *IP spoofing*
			* involves altering the source IP address of a packet.
			* An attacker may use IP spoofing to attempt to bypass access control lists (ACLs) on a router or firewall
		* *E-mail spoofing*
			* invloves altering the soruce e-mail address of an e-mail message.
			* Email spoofing is typically used by an attacker in a phishing attack to make the e-mail look like it is coming from someone else (a trusted party).
* **Man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack**
	* With an MITM attack, the hacker inserts himself in the middle of two systems that are communicating.
	* He then passes the information back and forth between the two, with neither party knowing all the communication is passing through the hacker's system.
	* The benefit of this is the hacker can then view any sensitive data sent between the two systems.
* **Hijack attack**
	* A hacker takes over a session between you and another individual and disconnects the other individual from the communication.
	* You still belive that you are taking to the original party and may send private information to the hacker instead of the original party.
* **Deinal of service**
	* A deinal-of-service (DoS) attack causes the system or its services to either crash or become unresponsive.
* **Distributed deinal of service (DDoS)**
	* With a DDoS, the hacker uses multiple systems to attack a single target system.
* **Buffer overflow**
	* In a buffer overflow attack, the attacker sends more data to a buffer than it can hold.
	* The data may include malicious code that may corrupt data or cause private information to be revealed, providing the attacker the ability to gain administrative access to the system in a command prompt or shell.
* **Exploit attack**
	* In this type of attack, the attacker knows of a security problem (a vulnerability) within an operating system or a piece of software and leaverages that knowledge by exploiting the vulnerability.
* **Botnet**
	* A botnet is a group of systems that a hacker takes over and uses in a DDoS attack.
* **DNS poisoning**
	* With DNS poisoning, a hacker alters (or poisons) your DNS data in order to redirect clients to the wrong system.
	* In another common attack against DNS, a hacker tries to do a zone transfer (copy your DNS data)
* **Sumrf attack**
	* In a smurf attack, the hacker sends a ping message to a number of systems but spoofs the IP address so that it look the ping messages are comming from different systems.
	* The result is that all the systems send ping replies to the victim, essentially performing a DDoS.
* **Friendly/unintentional Dos**
	* Some scenarios can lead to an unintentional DoS attack.
	* For example, an account lockout policy could lead a DoS, preventing the user from logging on once the account is locked. Users may unintentionally cause a DoS if they delete a file by accident.
* **Physical attack**
	* Physical attacks when the attacker gains physical access to your facility and is able to cause damage to your equipement or even the facility.
* **ARP poisoning**
	* A hacker can insert himself in the middle of communication by altering the Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) cache on a victim's system and causing all communication to pass through the hacker's system, enabling him to capture all traffic.
	* This is a common method to perform an MITM attack.
* **VLAN hopping**
	* VLAN hopping is an exploit against virtual local area networks (VLANs) that enables an individual to gain access to a VLAN when he is not connected to it.
	* Hackers accomplish this by double-tagging the frames for different VLANs, or they can imitate a trunking port so that they receive all traffic.
* **Deauthentication**
	* A deauthentication attack is common in wireless attacks. The hacker sends a command to disconnect or deauthenticate the client from the wireless network.
	* As a result, the client is forced to reauthenticate with the wireless network where the hacker can capture the reauthentication traffic. The authentication packets can be replayed by the attacker in order to generate more traffic in hopes of cracking the wireless encryption.
* **Zero-day attacks**
	* In a zero-day attack, a vulnerability unknown by the software developer is exploited before the developer realized the problem and issues a patch.
	* Companies can have a team in place to test software and identify vulnerabilities not yet known.

#### Password Attacks

* **Dictionary attack**
	* This attack involves the use of a word list file, which is a list of potential passwords.
	* The attacker uses a program to read and try each of the passwords from the file to break into a system.
	* This is very quick form of password attack, because no calculations are required: the attacker is simply reading a file.
* **Brute-force attack**
	* In a brute-force attack, the attacker uses a program that tries every possible combination of characters to guess a password.
	* This attack is slower than a dictionary attack because a file is not read; instead, the program calculates each possible password.
* **Hybrid attack**
	* Like a dictionary attack, a hybrid attack involves a word list file, but is also places numbers at the end of the words to catch passwords that are not dictionary words, in case a password contains a number at the end, which is common.

## Authentication and Authroization Concepts

The process of logging on to the network is known as *authentication*, whereas controlling that network resources users may access once they have logged on to the network is known as *authorization*.

### Authentication

Authentication is the process whereby users or computers identify themselves to the network so that they can start accessing network resources or a network device (in the case of managing the device).

The method used to authenticate a user depends on the network environment and can assume forms such as the following:

* **Username and password**
	* When the user starts the computer or connects to the network, she types a username and password that are associated with the user's particular network account.
* **Smartcard**
	* Using a smartcard for logon is similar to accessing yoru bank account at an ATM.
	* To log on to the network, you insert a smartcard, which is similar to a debit card, into a smartcard reader and then supply a PIN.
	* Smartcards are also known as PKI cards because they are used to authenticate the client in a public key infrastructure (PKI) environment; the card contains the employee's private key.
* **Biometrics**
	* In this case, the user provides a retina scan or fingerprint as a credential.

Whatever method is used to provide the necessary credentials, the outcome is the same, in the sense that the credentials are sent to a directory sevice, where they are verified.

If the username and password are correct, the user is authenticated and allowed to access network resources. Network servers also have the ability to authoize users to access different resources, depending on how they are authenticated.

**Standard authentication protocols**

* **Password Authentiation Protocol (PAP)**
	* PAP sends the user's credentials in plain text and is very insecure, because it is easy for someone to analyze and interpret the logon traffic.
* **Challenge Handshake Authentication Protocol (CHAP)**
	* With CHAP, the server sends a client a challenge (a key), which is combined with the user's password.
	* Both the user's password and the challenge are run through the MD5 hashing algorithm, which generates a hash value, or mathematical answer, and that hash value is sent to the server for authentication.
	* The server uses the same key to create a hash value with the password stored on the server and then compares the resulting values are the same, the client has supplied the correct password.
	* The benefit is that the user's credentials have not been passed on the wire at all.
* **MS Challenge Handshake Authentication Protocol (MS-CHAP)**
	* MS-CHAP is a variation of CHAP and uses the MD4 hashing algorithm rather than MD5, which is used by CHAP.
	* MS-CHAP also uses the Microsoft Point-to-Point Encryption (MPPE) protocol along with MS-CHAP to encrypt all traffic from the client to the server.
* **MS-CHAPv2**
	* With MS-CHAP version 2, the authentication method has been extended to authenticate both the client and the server.
	* MS-CHAPv2 also uses stronger encryption keys than CHAP and MS-CHAP.
* **Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP)**
	* EAP allows for multiple logon methods, such as smartcard logon, certificates, Kerberos, and public-key authentication.
	* EAP is also frequently used with Remote Authentication Dial In User Service (RADIUS), which is a central authentication service that can be used by RAS, wireless, or VPN solutions.

#### Password Alternatives

* **Biometrics**
* **Certificates**
	* A certificate is an electronic file that contains encryption keys and other properties, such as the owner's ID and who created the certificate.
	* The certificate is typically stored on a PKI card (smartcard), or it could be on a USB stick.

#### Authentication Factors

* **Something you know**
	* This is the most common authentication factor, where you know information to prove your identify.
	* An example of this authentication factor is knowing a password or a PIN.
* **Something you have**
	* This is based on your having something in your possession that enables you to gain access to the environment.
	* For example, you use a swipe card or physical token to enter a building.
* **Something you are**
	* This authentication factor involves biometrics: you use a characteristic of yourself for authentication.

If you are authenticating to a system by using only one of the authentication factors, you are using a *single-factor authentication* scheme.
A *two-factor authentication* scheme is based on two authentication factors.

**Common examples of two-factor authentication schemes**

* **Physical token and password**
	* You authenticate with someting you have and something you know.
* **Smartcard and PIN**
	* You authenticate with somethign you have and someting you know
* **Biometrics and password**
	* You authenticate with something you are and something you know.
* **Logon credential, and then access code from mobile phone notification**
	* In this example, you would log on with your username and password, and then a notification is sent to your phone with a one-time access code you will need to type when logging into the application.
	* This is example of something you know (username and password), and something you have (phone).

Multifactor authentication (MFA) requires you to log in with two or more factors.

#### Single Sign-On

When you authenticate to the network that offers Single Sign-On (SSO), you can access multiple systems based on that single authentication information.
So with SSO, you are not required to authenticate with each different system you access, you authenticate once and then can gain access to multiple systems without authenticating again.

### Authorization

Once you have been authenticated to the network, you will be authorized to access networking resources.

There are various types of authroization, depending on what it is that you are trying to be authroized for. For example, if you are trying to access a file on the network, authroization is determined according to the permissions assigned to the file. If you are trying to change the time on the server, authroization is determined by your privileges, or rights.

From Cisco networkign point of view, authroization is implemented as access control lists, which are configured on the router to allow or deny traffic from entering or leaving the network.

#### Permissions vs. Rights (privileges)

A *permission* is your level of access to a resource such as a file, folder, or object.
The permission is a characteristic of the resource and not a characteristic of the user account.
For example, if an administrator wanted to give Bob read permission to a file, the admin would go to the properties of that file and set the permissions.

#### Controlling Traffic

A Cisco example of authoriation is the access control list (ACL). To authroize which traffic is allowed to enter of leave different parts of your network, you will configure rules on your firewall or Cisco routers.

The ACL is a list of these rules that either permit or deny different types of traffic from entering or leaving your network.
The router receives a packet and then typically allows or denies the packet based on the protocol, the source or destination IP address (IP filtering), or the soruce and destination port (port filtering).

#### Network Access Control

Network Access Control (NAC) is enabless you to authroize who can gain access to a wired or wireless network based on the state of the connecting system, known as *posture assessment*.

With NAC, you can specify conditions that a system must meet in order to gain access to the network. If those conditions are not met, the user can be sent to a restricted network, where he can take actions to remedy the problem.

For example, you may require that for a system to connect to the network, it must have antivirus software installed, and the antivirus definitions must be up-to-date. You may also require that the system have a personal firewall enabled. If any of these conditions is not met, the NAC system places the client on a restriected network, where the user can typically apply patches or, in this case, perfom an update of the virus definitions.

Today, NAC is used in many scenarios, as demonstrated in the following examples:

* **Connecting to wireless**
	* When connecting to a wireless network, the NAC system may require you to accept the terms of wireless network usage before you are given access to the network.
* **Patch status**
	* A client connects to a network, either locally or through VPN, and the client's health is checked to ensure that it has antivirus software installed, that virus definitions are up-to-date, and that the system is up-to-date with patches before the client is allowed to connect to the network.
* **Connecting to a switch**
	* If the switch is 802.1x-compliant, it can be configured to ensure that the connecting client is authenticated by an authentication service (such as RADIUS) before allowing the client access to the network.

#### Port Security

The port security feature of a switch enables you to control which systems can connect to individual ports on the switch according to their MAC addresses.

#### Network Segmentation

It is important to ensure that you separate different types of systems, or environments, from one another to help increase security.

You typically segment systems by not providing a physical connection between the two networks, or, if you need to have a physical connection, you use a router or firewall to control communication between the types of systems using ACLs.
VLANs are also a great switch feature to help implement different network segments.

In the following scenarios, it is important to implement network segmentation:

* **Legacy systems**
	* You may want to separate a legacy system from the rest of the network because the legacy system is running older software or protocols.
	* Or you may want to segment the legacy system because it is older and potentially not as secure as newer systems, because patches for the old system are no longer being provided.
* **Separate private/public networks**
	* You should separate the private network (your LAN) from any untrusted public network (such as the Internet) to help reduce chances of attacks from the Internet.
* **Honeypots/honeynets**
	* A honeypot is a system or network designed to attract a hacker to attack it instead of attcking a production system or network.
	* You want to ensure that you segment the honeypot environment from the production environment so that a hacker who is tricked into trying to hack into the honeypot does not see the production system or network.
* **Testing labs**
	* Any test environment should be segmented from the production network.
	* One good reason to do this is a test lab typically uses the same IP addresses and computer names that the production systems are using, so you want to make sure that the systems are not on the same network to prevent IP and name conflicts.
* **Performance optimization and load balancing**
	* You may choose to segment systems as a way to load balance some of the work. For example, instead having all users connect to one server for service, you can place that service on two different servers, which are each on a different network. This way, each network is being serviced by one server with half the traffic.
	* You could also load balance traffic by having a separate switch or wiring closet for each floor connect to a layer 3 switch to segmeent the traffic of each floor from traffic of the others.
* **Compliance**
	* You may need to separate systems using different segments to comply with regulations or other requirements.
		* For example, a vendor may not support a product unless it is separated from different types of systems.
	* Regulations governing your organization may also have compliance requirements that involve controlling communication to systems that store sensitive data.
		* For example, the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCIDSS) requires isolating any system storing or processing credit card data on its own network segment.

### Accounting

After the individual authenticates to the system, he is then authroized (or not authorized) to perfom different actions on the system or network.
*Accounting* then kicks in, tracking and logging the actions that the user performs while accessing the system or network. Accounting is very important to security; by logging user actions, the user is held accountable for all of her actions.

Following are some examples of activity that may be tracked:

* **Internet usage**
	* Log each web site that the user visits
* **File access**
	* Log each time a user accesses certain files on a server or, more importantly, each time a user deletes or copies a file.
* **Database access**
	* Log when a user access certain data in a database or changes or deletes data in the database.

### AAA Services

The services of authentication, authorization, and accounting are collectively known in the industry as AAA services.

* **Authentication**
	* The authentication service is responsible for validating the credentials presented by the user and typically involves having an authentication database of criteria.
* **Authroization**
	* Once the account information has been verified, the user is granted access to the network.
	* The authroization component may need criteria other than account information before granting access.
* **Accounting**
	* Accounting deals with logging activity performed by users and administrators, so that users can be held accountable for their actions.
	* Accounting also be used to help determine how much money each department should be paying for the service

Many AAA solutions have been released over the years, such as RADIUS and TACACS+.
These service offer the benefit of a central system that can offer authentication, authorization, and accounting for many types of environments, such as wired network, wireless networks, and VPNs.

#### RADIUS

Remote Access Dial-In User Service (RADIUS) is a central authentication service that has been popular for many years.

The client computer that needs access to the network connects to the network by attempting to connect to a switch or a wireless access point, or by making a connection to a VPN server from across the Internet.
In this case, the switch, wireless access point, or VPN server is known as the RADIUS client, because it sends the authentication request to the RADIUS server that is running in the background.
This RADIUS server verifies the credentials and sends back a reply that indicates whether the network client is to be granted or denied access.

![[Pasted image 20251114082927.png]]

#### TACACS and XTACACS

TACACS originated as an authentication service that ran on UNIX systems.

TACACS services used TCP and UDP port 49. A few years after TACACS was introduced, Cisco created its own proprietary authentication service called *Extended TACACS (XTACACS)*, which worked as a central authentication service for Cisco device.

#### TACACS+

The TACACS+ protocol is the AAA protocol used by Cisco networks and supersedes the original TACACS and XTACACS protocols.

TACACS+ uses TCP for communication and uses the same topology used by RADIUS in the sense that the client tries to connect to the Cisco switch, and the switch, which is the TACACS client in this case, sends the authentication request to the TACACS server.
TACACS+ has been improved over RADIUS from a security standpoint, because it encrypts all information betwen the TACACS client and the TACACS server, whereas RADIUS encrypts only the password between the RADIUS client and the RADIUS server.

## Password Policy Elements

### Password Complexity

A *complex password* is a password that is at least eight characters long and requires the inclusion of lowercase letters, uppercase letters, numbers, and symbols.
For example, jT94q$ym4C would be complex password.

The problem with using complex passwords, however, is that they are difficult to remember.

### Password Policy

* **Minimum password length**
	* Specifiy how long a password must be.
* **Maximum password age**
	* Speficy how frequently (in days) users will need to change their passwords.
* **Password history**
	* Specify that a user cannot change a password to a password they've already used.
* **Miminum password age**
	* Specify how long users must keep a password before they are allowed to change it again.
	* The purpose of this policy is to stop someone from voluntarily changing his password a large number of times in a row to remove a password from the password history, which would enable him to reuse an old password, bypassing the password history requirement.
* **Complexity requirements**
	* Specify that the password include uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols.

### Account Lockout Policy

An account lockout policy helps you protect user accounts from being hacked.
With an account lockout policy, you specify that after a certain number of bad logon attempts, an account will be locked and cannot be used. You also specify for how long the account is locked; typically, the account is locked until the administrator unloks it.

* **Account lockout threshold**
	* The number of bad logon attempts that will be tolerated before the account is locked.
* **Account lockout duration**
	* The number of minutes that the account will be locked.
* **Reset account lockout counter after**
	* How long before the bad logon threshold resets back to zero.

### Account and Password Management

#### Password Expiration

Password policies are set to expire after a maximum amount of time.
Suppose, for example, that you set a user's password expiration to 30 days. This means that after a user has used a password for 30 days, it will expire. The next time the user logs on, she'll be asked to change her password. If anythone goes wrong with a password rest, you may need to reset the password for a user with your user account management tool.

#### Disable Accounts

If an employee takes a leave from work, such as a parental leave, or quits his job, the first thing you should do is disable the user's account so that the employee cannot log on and use that account.

#### Remove Unnecessary Accounts

Every so often, you should audit the user accounts that exist on your environemt and identify those that are no longer needed and can be removed. If you are sure the account is no longer necessary, you can delete the account.

## Remote Access and VPNs

### VPN Overview

Once the Internet become popular, allowing users in remote (off-premises) locations to communicate with distant networks was an obvious solution.
Many security issues are involved in sending data across the Internet. Virtual private networks (VPNs) offer a solution.
With a VPN, user can connect to the Internet using some connection. Once the Internet connection is achieved, the user can use the IP address of the VPN server to create a "secure tunnel".

VPNs offer two major benefits: they provide secure communication across an unsecure medium, and no costs are incurred to communicate between the two locations.
Once all systems have an Internet connection, VPN solutions leverage that connection and add security to it.

#### VPN Protocols

* **Point-to-Point Tunneling Protocol (PPTP)**
	* This older VPN protocol is used to encrypt Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP). PPTP uses the Generic Routing Encapsulation (GRE) protocol to transport the PPP packets, but is uses the Microsoft Point-to-Point Encryption (MPPE) protocol to encrypt the traffic. To allow PPTP traffic to pass through the firewall, you will need to open TCP port 1723 (control port) and protocol ID 47 (carries the data) on the firewall.
* **Layer 2 Tunneling Protocol (L2TP)**
	* L2TP uses the more secure IPsec (Internet Protocol Security) for encryption of traffic instead of MPPE.
	* To allow L2TP traffic through your firewall, you will need to open UDP port 500 (for key exchange), UDP port 550 (for IPsec NAT), and UDP port 1701 on the firewall.
* **Secure Socket Transport Protocol (SSTP)**
	* SSTP has a benefit in that it uses Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) to encrypt the VPN traffic, making it easy to configure the firewall to allow VPN traffic to pass through, you simply need to open the SSL port 443.

**Security protocols**

* **Generic Routing Encapsulation (GRE)**
	* GRE is a networking protocol that is designed to create a point-to-point tunnel between two devices.
	* As a tunneling protocol, GRE is used to establish the point-to-point link and then encapsulate other types of traffic, such as IPv4 or IPv6 packets, into the GRE packet.
* **IPsec**
	* This protocol is used to encrypt all IP traffic once IPsec has been configured on the system or device.
	* The IPsec protocol uses Encapsulation Security Payload (ESP) to encrypt traffic, Authentication Header (AH) protocol for message integrity and authentication, and Internet Key Exchange (IKE) to exchange encryption keys between systems.
* **ISAKMP**
	* The Internet Security Association and Key Management Protocol
	* ISAKMP is responsible for setting up a secure channel (known as a security association) and exchanging keys.
	* ISAKMP is used by IKE for authentication before key exchange.

#### Remote Access VPNs

Users (or an administrator) can install VPN software on a laptop to connect over the Internet to a VPN server at work through a secure tunnel from the laptop to the company network.
This helps ensure the security of data travelig through the tunnel.
The VPN software running on the company laptop uses one of the VPN protocols mentioned earlier to encrypt data from the laptop across the Internet, and to the company network.

#### Site-to-Site VPNs

Another common topology in use is the site-to-site VPN solution. In this case, a VPN appliance, typically a router with VPN capabilities, is installed at each location that is used to create the encrypted tunnel from one location to another.

The clients are not establishing the tunnel, so they do not need a configured VPN connection to the remote location from their own system. Instead, they will go through a network device such as a router that will create the VPN tunnel to the other location.

Site-to-Site VPNs are commonly used to connect branch offices to a head office.

With a remote access VPN, the endpoint device has VPN software installed to create the secure tunnel, while with a site-to-site VPN, the routers or firewalls create the secure tunnel for that network location.

### Remote Administration Protocols

To manage devices remotely, you will use a remote administration protocol.

* **Telnet**
	* Enables you to connect to your switch or router and make administrative changes remotely.
* **SSH**
	* Sends all data in an encrypted format, including the authentiation traffic (username and password).
* **RDP**
	* The Remote Desktop Protocol is used for remote authentication of workstations and servers on the network.

## Implementing a Security Program

A good security program involves a number of elements, such as user awareness, training programs, and the implementation of physical accss control methods.

### User Awareness

* **Not sharing passwords**
* **Using string passwords**
* **Keeping doors shut and locked**
* **Keeping a clean desk**
* **Not clicking links from untrusted sources**

### Employee Traning
