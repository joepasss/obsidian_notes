## Introduction to Networks

A *network* includes all of the components (hardware and software) involved in connecting computers and applications across small and large distances.

Networks are used to share information and services with users to help them increase their productivity.
For example, a network may share a printer on the network so that everyone in your office can access it, instead of each user needing his or her own printer.

### Network Characteristics

To design a successful network solution, you need to be familiar with the organization's need and goals.
Consider the following characteristics when designing a network:

* **Cost**
	* Includes the cost of the network components, their installation, and their ongoing maintenance.
* **Security**
	* Includes the protection of the network components and the data they contain and/or data transmitted between them.
* **Speed**
	* Includes how fast data is transmitted between network endpoints (the data rate).
* **Topology**
	* Describes the physical cabling layout and the logical way data moves between components.
* **Scalability**
	* Defines how well the network can adopt to new growth, including new users, applications, and network components.
* **Reliability**
	* Defines the ability of network components to provide the appropriate levels of support and the required connectivity levels.
	* The *mean time between failures* (MTBF) is a mesurement commonly used to indicate the likelihood of a component failing.
* **Availability**
	* Measures the likelihood of the network being available to the users, where downtime occurs when the network is not available because of an outage or scheduled maintenance.
	* Availability is typically measured in a percentage based on the number of minutes that exist in a year.
	* Therefore, *uptime* would be the number of minutes the network is available devided by the number of minutes in a year.

### Network Components

*Applications*, is the software that enables users to perform various tasks, make up a key component of networking.
Many applications are *network-aware*, which means they enable you to access and use resources that are not stored directly on your local computer.

Some of the more common networking applications in use in most organizations include e-mail applications, File Transfer Protocol (FTP), and web applications

*Protocols* are used to enable systems to talk to one another on the network.
Some protocols are *open standard*, meaning that many vendors can create applications that can interoperate with other applications using that protocol.
Other protocols are *proprietary*, meaning that they work only with other applications created by a particular vendor.

**List of common Internet Protocols**
* **Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP)**
	* The Internet protocol for sending e-mails
* **Post Office Protocol 3 (POP3)**
	* The Internet protocol for downloading e-mail from e-mail server to your system so that you can read the e-mail
* **Internet Message Access Protocol version 4 (IMAP4)**
	* The Internet protocol used to read e-mail.
	* IMAP4 supports additional capabilities and folder support over POP3.
* **File Transfer Protocol (FTP)**
	* The Internet protocol for trasnferring file across the Internet.
* **Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP)**
	* The protocol used to deliver web pages from a web server to a web browser.
	* All of the popular web servers such as Internet Information Services (IIS) and Apache are running an HTTP server.

Some applications (e-mail), require little bandwidth, while others (such as backup software, video software, and file transfer software) requires a lot.
Some applications operate in real-time (voice over IP, video), some operate interactivly (instance messaging and database queries)

Today's networks need to accommodate all these different types of resources and applications, including their specific requirements, such as bandwidth for large transfers or minimal delay and latency for VoIP and video.
*Quality of Service (QoS)* features are commonly used to meet these requirements.

To build a network, you need three component categories:

* **Networking software**
	* There are two types of software components (server and client)
	* The server software offers some form of service to clients on the network
* **Networking hardware**
	* hubs, switches, routers, firewalls, wireless access points, modems, and channel service units/data service units (CSUs/DSUs)
	* responsible for moving information between the LAN and WAN.
* **Media type**
	* Media types such as copper of fiber cabling.
	* Wireless communication also falls in this category, because it is used to transmit data from one system to another on the network.

### Local Area Networks

Local area networks (LANs) are used to connect networking devices that reside in a close geographic area, such as a floor of a building, a building itself, or withing a compus environment.

In a LAN, you'll find a range of different types of devices, such as PCs, servers, switchese, routers, multilayer switches, voice gateways, firewalls, and other devices.

The media types used in LANs include copper and fiber cabling. 
They can also include Ethernet, Fast Ethernet (FE), Gigabit Ethernet (GE), Token Ring, and Fiber Distributed Data Interface (FDDI), which are different network architectures.

Today, most networks are some from of Ethernet.

### Wide Area Networks

Wide area networks (WANs) are used to connect mulitple LANs together.

For example, suppose you have an office in Boston (a LAN) and an office in Vancouver (another LAN); a WAN is used to connecte these two LANs together so that users can communicate with other used and systems on both LANs.

Typically, WANs are used when the LANs that must be connected are separated by a large distance. Whereas a corporation provides its own infrastructure for a LAN, WANs are leased from carrier networks, such as telephone companies and Internet service providers (ISPs).

Four basic types of connections, or circuits, are used in WAN services: circuit-switched, cell-switched, packet-switched, and dedicated connections.

A wide array of WAN services available to connect different office locations, including analog dialup, Asynchronus Transfer Mode (ATM), dedicated circuits, cable, digital subscriber line (DSL), Frame Relay, Integrated Service Digital Network (ISDN), and X.25.

Analog dialup and ISDN are examples of circuit-switched services; ATM is an example of a cell-swiched service; and Frame Relay and X.25 are examples of packet-swiched services.

*Circuit-swiched services* provide a temporary connection across a phone circuit.
In networking, these services are typically used for backup of primary circuits and for temporary bosts of bandwidth.
More commonly today, celluar wireless services (3G and 4G) are used for dial-on-demand applications or backup connections.

A *dedicated circuit* is permanent connection between two sites in which the bandwidth is dedicated to that company's use.
These circuits are common when a variety of services, such as a voice, video, and data, must traverse the connection and you want guaranteed bandwidth available.

*Cell-switched* services can provide the same features that dedicated circuits offer, such as having a dedicated link, but one of its advantages over dedicated circuits is that it enables a single device to connect to multiple devices on the same interface.
The downside of these services is that they are not available at all locations, they are difficult to set up and troubleshoot, and the equipment is expensive when compared to equipment used for dedicated circuits.

*Packet-switched* services are smiliar to cell-swiched services, except cell-swiched services switch *fixed-length* packets called cells and packet-switched services switch *variable-length* packets.
This feature makes packet-swiched services better suited for data services, but they can nonetheless provide some of the QoS features that cell-swiched services provide.

Two other WAN services that are very popular technologies for high-speed Internet connections are digital subscriber-lines (DSLs) and cable.

DSL provides speeds up to a few megabits per second (Mbps) and costs much less than a typicall WAN circuit from the carrier.
It supports both voice and video and doesn't require a dialup connection (it's always enabled).
The main disadvantage of DSL is that coverage is limited to about 18,000 feet, and the service is not available in all areas.

Cable supports higher data rates than DSL, but like DSK, it provides a full-time connection. However, cable has two major drawbacks: it is shared service and functions in a logical bus topology much like Ethernet, so the more customers in an area that connect via cable, the less bandwidth each customer has; also, because many people are sharing the medium, it is more susceptible to security risks such as eavesdropping on other subscribers' traffic.

## Common Network Services and Devices

### Types of Services

* **DNS server**
	* This service is responsible for resolving fully qualified domain names (FQDNs) to IP addresses.
* **DHCP server**
	* This service is responsible for assigning IP addresses to computers and devices when they connect to the network so that they can communicate with other systems on the network.
* **HTTP server**
	* This service is responsible for hosting web pages that can be delivered to clients that connect to the web server.
* **File server**
	* This services is used to hold all of the data files for a company.
	* A file server typically has lots of storage space and becomes the central point of storage for the company.
	* It also becomes the central location of backup to ensure that company data files backed up.
* **Application server**
	* This server has specified applications installed to provide services on the network.
* **SMTP/POP**
	* This service runs specific protocols that enable the e-mail software to send or receive e-mails.
	* SMTP is the Internet protocol for sending e-mail.
	* POP is the Internet protocol for reading e-mails.
* **FTP**
	* This service can be installed on a host to enable someone to connect to the network and transfer files across the network or Internet.
	* FTP uses TCP as the transport layer protocol and supports authentication.
* **TFTP**
	* The Trivial File Transfer Protocol service enables you to upload or download a file.
	* TFTP uses the User Datagram Protocol (UDP) and does not support authentication.
* **Ping**
	* command-line tool is used to test connectivity with another system.
	* `ping <ip_addr>` to send a test message to a remote system.
* **Telnet**
	* Create a remote connection to a system, using a text-based interface of the system to perform remote administration.
	* Telnet sends all communication in clear text including the username and password
* **SSH**
	* Secure Shell is the secure method of performing remote administration of a device on the network.
	* SSh encrypts all communication including the username and password
	* secure replacement to telnet

### Network Infrastructure Components

#### Hub

A hub is an older network device that you hopefully do not encounter on your networks, because they have been replaced by the more effective and secure swiches.

A network hub had three pitfalls:

* **No filtering**
	* When a system was to send data to another system, the hub would receive the data and then send the data to all other ports on the hub.
	* The hub is a layer 1 device, so it simply received the signal and sent it to all ports; it dose not understand Media Access Control (MAC) address, but a switch does.
* **Collisions**
	* Because any data sent was sent to all other ports, and because any system could send its own data at any time, this resulted in a lot of collisions on the network.
* **Security**
	* Because the data was sent to all ports on the hub, all systems receive all data.
	* Systems look at the destination address in the frame to decide whether to process the data or discard it. But if someone was running a packet sniffer on a system that used a hub, he would receive all packets and be able to read them.

#### LAN Switch

Swiches are one of the most common devices used on networks tody.
All other devices connect to the switch to gain access to the network.

##### Layer 2 Switch

The switch tracks every device's MAC address and then associates that device's MAC address with the port on the switch to which the device is connected.
The switch stores this information in a MAC address table in memory on the switch.

The switch traks every device's MAC address and then associates that devices's MAC address with the port on the switch to which the device is connected.
The switch stores this information in a MAC address table in memory on the switch.
The switch then acts as a filtering device by sending data only to the port that the data destined for.

![[Pasted image 20250929063909.png]]

Computer A is sending data (a frame) to computer C.
The frame enters the switch through the port that computer A is connected (port 2).
The switch reads the destination address of the frame and sees it is destined for cccc.cccc.cccc (Computer C).
The switch then checks the MAC table in memory to see what port has the MAC address of cccc.cccc.cccc.
The switch notes that computer C is connected to port 4 and then forwards the data to port 4.

#### Router

A switch is used to connect all systems together in a LAN type of setup.
If you want to send data from your network to another network or across the Internet, use router.

A Router sends, or routes, data from one network to another until the data reaches its final desintaion.
Note that although switches look at the MAC address to decide where to forward a frame, routers use the IP address to determine what network to send the data to.

The router has a routing table, which is a list of all the networks that it knows how to reach.
A router also includes a *gateway of last resort* (GWLR) settings that is used if the router does not have a route to the destination in its routing table.

![[Pasted image 20250929064401.png]]

If Computer A wanted to send data to Computer D:

1. The data would leave computer A's network card and go to the switch.
2. The switch would forward the frame to the R1 router.
3. The R1 router would look at the destination address of the data and note that data is destined for Computer D on the 14.0.0.0 network.
4. Router R1 would look at its routing table to determine wheter it knows how to send data to the 14.0.0.0 network.
5. The data is then sent to router R2
6. When router R2 receives the data, it looks at the destination address of the data and determines that it need to send the data to computer D on the LAN.

#### Layer 3 Switch

A layer 3 switch performs all the functions of a layer 2 switch, but it also has added functionality of *being* a router.
Since most companies purchase a switch to connect their devices and then purchase a router 3 to send data out to the WAN or Internet, Cisco includes layer 3 switches that serve as a router and switch, all in one device.

#### Connecting to WAN with CSU/DSU

The *channel service unit/data service unit (CSU/DSU)* is a device that enables an organization to connect a high-speed data link from the ISP to the orgainization's router for access to and from a LAN or WAN.
These high-speed connections are usually T1 or T3 connections or their European counterparts, E1 and E3.
The CSU/DSU used will be specific to the speed of the line being connected to and from the service provider.

The CSU/DSU device handles signaling over the T1/T3 link, sending data between your router and the service provider. The CSU/DSU performs other functions as well, such as protecting against interface from either side of the link.

You may have an *external CSU/DSU* device that connects to the serial port on your organization's router and is used to connect the T1 line from your service provider.

Many routers today come with an internal CSU/DSU module installed, which enables you to connect the router to the T1 line without the use of an external CSU/DSU.

The *demarc*, also known as the *demarcation point*, is the point where the service provider's equipment connects to your building. The term is used to identify which party is responsible for a particular problem.
For example, if the equipment that is faulty is on your company's side of the demarc point, it is your company's problem to fix; if the problem is on the service provider's side of the demarc point, the responsiblity to solve the problem falls into the service provider's hands.

The *demarc extension* refers to the area between the connection into your building (from the service provider) and your company's communication equipment.
The demarc extension is typically a patch cable that connects the service provider's line to your company's network equipment.

**Demarcation point and demarc extension**
![[Pasted image 20250929065802.png]]

#### Firewalls

Firewalls control which traffic is allowed to enter a network or system and which traffic should be blocked.

When configuring a firewall, you create the rules for allowing and denying traffic based on the protocol, port number, and direction of the traffic.

Three major types of firewall are used:
* **Packet filtering firewall**
	* Can filter traffic based on the source and destination IP addresses, the source and destination port numbers, and the protocol used.
	* It does not understand the context of the conversation, so it is easy for hacker to craft a packet to pass through the firewall
* **Stateful packet inspection firewall**
	* Filters traffic based on source and destination IP addresses, the source and destination port numbers, and the protocol in use, but it also understands the context of a conversation and will not allow a packet through the firewall unless it suits a specific scenario.
	* If a hacker sends a packet to your network and tries to make it look like the packet is a response from a web site that someone visited, your firewall will know that no one visited that site, so will not allow the traffic through.
* **Next-generation firewall (NGFW)**
	* layer 7 firewall that can inspect the application data and detect malicious packets.
	* A regular firewall filters traffic based on it being HTTP or FTP traffic (using port numbers), but it cannot determine if there is malicious data inside the HTTP or FTP packet.
	* An application-layer NGFW can inspect the application data that exists in the packet and determine whether is suspcious content inside.

#### Intrusion Prevention System

An *Intrusion Prevention system (IPS)* is a security device that monitors activity, logs any suspicious activity, and then some form of corrective action.
For example, if someone is doing a port scan on the network, the IPS would discover this suspicious activity, log the activity, and then disconnect the system that is performing the port scan from the network.

#### DHCP

DHCP is responsible for assigning IP address information automatically to systems on the network.
The network administrator configures the DHCP server by configuring a *scope* that the server can assign addresses from.

The DHCP service may configure a client with all the TCP/IP settings, including the subnet mask, the default gateway, and the address of the DNS server.

When a client start up, it sends out a broadcast message looking for a DHCP server to receive an IP address from.
The DHCP server replies with an offer, and the client then requests the address that has been offered.
Finally, the DHCP service acknowledges that the client has the address for a period of time (known as the lease duration).

#### Network Address Translation

NAT enables us to hide our internal network structure from the outside world by having the NAT device receive all outbound packets, take the internal source address out, and replace it with the public IP address of the NAT device.

This is beneficial because anyone who intercepts the data on the internet will believe that the packet came from the NAT device and not the internal computer on the LAN.
As a resoult, anyone who decides to attack the source of the packets will be attacking the NAT device instead, which will typically be a firewall products as well.

#### Wireless Access Points/Access Points

An *access point* is a device added to your network that enables wireless clients to connect to the network.
Many organizations that want to have the flexibility of offering wireless connectivity to clients will strategically place wireless access points throughout the building, enabling wireless clients to make connections to the network.

#### Wireless LAN Controllers

Configuring each access poing on a network can be a time-consuming undertaking, with lots of potentials for errors.
As a network administrator, you can centrally manage devices instead of needing to run around to each device and perform the configuration.

Administrator can use a wireless LAN controller (WLC), or wireless controller for short, to manage access points centrally using the Lightweight Access Point Protocol (LWAPP).

#### Cisco DNA Center

Cisco DNA Center is an appliance you can purchase that enables you to manage changes to your network devices cetrally and simultaneously.

The benefit of DNA Center is that you can use a number of software elements, such as scripts, to automate changes to all your devices at one time.

#### Endpoints and Servers

* **Client**
	* A client system, connects to the network to access resources (files, printers, ...) or Internet
* **Server**
	* A server system provides resources to the network.
* **Printer**
* **Mobile device**

### Collision Domains and Broadcast Domains

* ***Collision domain**
	* In this group of systems, simultaneous data transmissions can collide with one another.
* **Broadcast domain**
	* In this group of systems, each system can receive other systems' broadcast messages.

#### Collision Domain

In a collision domain, data transmission collisions can occur.

For example, suppose you are using a hub to connect five systems to a network. Because traffic is sent to all ports on the hub, it is possible that if several systems send data at the same time, the data could collide on the network.
For this reason, all network ports on a hub are considered parts of a *single collision domain*.

If you were using a switch to connect the five systems together, each port on the switch would create its own network segment.
When data is sent by a system connected to the switch, the switch sends the data only to the port that the destination system resides on.
For this reason, if another system were to send data at the same time, the data would not collide. As a result, each port on the switch creates a *separate* collision domain.

#### Broadcast Domain

A broadcast domain is a group of systems that can receive one another's broadcast messages.

When using a hub to connect five systems in a network environment, if one system sends a broadcast message, the message is received by all other systems connected to the hub.
For this reason, all ports on the hub create *single broadcast* domain.

Likewise, if all five systems were connected to a switch and one of the systems sent a broadcast message, the broadcast message would be received by all other systems on the network.
Therefore, when using a switch, all ports are part of the same broadcast domain as well.

If you wanted to control which systems received broadcast messages, you would have to use a router that does not forward broadcast message on to other networks.
You could also use virtual LANs (VLANs) on a switch, with each VLAN being a different broadcast domain.

### Network Design Models

A well-designed network is hierarchical in structure, where each layer in the hierarchy is focused on a specific job function.
A well-designed network is also modular, in the sense that it is easy to add components to the network, so that as the company grows, the network can grow.
The well-designed network should be flexible and resilient, meaning that it is always available and includes some form of redundancy.

When designing Cisco networks, we usually follow two common design models: the *three-tier architecuter model* and the *collapsed core architecutre model*

#### Three-tier Architecture

The three-tier architecture model is a common model used by Cisco network professionals to design a well-performing Cisco network.

* **Access layer**
	* This layer is at the bottom of the hierarchy; it enables end users to connect to the network via switches.
	* The access layer provides features that enable you to isolate traffic between different types of users and divide broadcast domains.
	* A switch located on each floor of a building would represent this layer.
* **Distribution layer**
	* The second layer from the bottom, or the middle layer, enables you to control who can access what part of the network by using features such as routing, access control lists and network access policies.
	* A distribution layer could be a central layer 3 switch residing in two buildings, in which each switch could access layer 3 switch of the other building to connect.
* **Core layer**
	* The top layer of the model represents the backbone of the network.
	* This layer is typically used to connect the networks of different buildings together.
	* It includes a number of core routers that are responsible for delivering traffic to and from the network.

#### Collapsed Core (Two-tier) Architecutre

A small organization may not need to use a three-layer model, so it can combine the distribution and core into single layer known as a *collapsed layer*.
This makes the collapsed core layer a two-layer model, comprising th access layer and the collapsed distribution/core layer.

In a typicall scenario, this may be used in a small company that uses only a few floors in a building for their network. Each floor would have a switch (access layer) that enables clients on that floor to connect to the network.
Each floor switch would then connect to a central switch in the building, which is connected to a router to access the WAN or Internet.

#### Spine-leaf Architecture

Another example of a two-tier architecture is the *spine-leaf architecture*, in which the lower layer is the leaf layer that contains the access switches that enable devices to connect to the network.

The leaf layer switches then connect to the spine layer switches, which connect all the switches to the rest of the network.

![[Pasted image 20250930073942.png]]

Note that the leaf layer switches are access layer switches with a full mesh topology that connects to the spine layer switches.

#### Small Office/Home Office (SOHO)

A SOHO network is a totally different network topology that is designed for a very small number of devices that need access to a network and the internet.

A SOHO network typically involves a high-speed internet connection into a home or office that connects to an ISP's modem.
The ISP's modem is connected to a WAN/Interent port on a wireless router, which usually has four switch ports that you can use to connecct clients using unshielded twisted pair (UTP) cabling.
A wireless router in a SOHO network could also provide a number of services, such as being a DHCP server, a NAT device, a firewall, or a wireless access point.

#### On-premises vs. Cloud

In most discussions of networking environments today, you will hear the terms *on-premises* versus the *cloud*.
On-premises networking capabilities or devices exist on your physical network at your office location.
If networking capabilities or devices reside in the cloud, this occurs at a cloud provider's network.

---

## Network Topologies

The *topology* of the network is the layout of the network.

![[Pasted image 20250930075510.png]]

* **Point to Point**
	* Has a single connection between two components
	* two components can directly communicate without interference from other components.
	* ex) two routers connected across a dedicated WAN link
* **Star**
	* Central device has many point-to-point connections to other components.
	* Used in environments in which many components need to be connected.
	* ex) 1000BaseTx Ethernet
* **Extended Star**
	* The main problem with a start topology is that if the center of the star fails, no components can communicate with others.
	* An extended start topology is basically multiple interconnected start topologies.
* **Bus**
	* All components are connected to and share a single architectures such as 10Base5 and 10Base2 Ethernet.
	* If any systems sends data on the wire, the data travels the entire lengh of the wire.
* **Ring**
	* Device one connects to device two, device two connects to device three, and so on the last device, which connects back to the first device.
	* Can be implemented as a single ring or a dual ring.
	* Dual rings are typically used when you need redundancy

### Physical vs. Logical Topologies

A *physical* topology describes how components are physically cabled together.
A *logical* topology describes how components communicate across the physical topology.

The physical and logical topology are independent of each other. For example, any variety of Ehternet uses a logical bus topology when components communicate, regardless of the physical layout of the cabling.

Token Ring is another good example of a network architecture that has a different physical topology from its logical one.
Physically, Token Ring uses a star topology, similar to 1000BaseT Ethernet. This means that each system is physically connected to a central device, but logically, Token Ring componenets use a ring topology to communicate between devices.

FDDI, on the other hand, is straightforward. FDDI's physical and logical topologies are the same: a ring.

### Fully and Partically Meshed Topologies

*Meshing* generically describes how componenents are connected together.
Two types of meshed topologies are used: *partial* and *full*.

In a partially meshed environment, every device is *not* connected to every other device.
In a fully meshed environment, every component is connected to every other component.

like physical and logical topologies, partial and full mesh can be seen from both a physical view and a logical one.
For example, in a physical bus topology, all the components are fully meshed, since they are all connected to the same piece of wire this is both a physical and a logical fully meshed topology and is common in LAN topologies.
WANs, on the other hand, because of their cost, commonly use partially meshed topologies to reduce the cost of connecting the components and locations.

> Number of links needed to fully mesh a WAN => N x (N - 1) / 2
> EX) if you had 10 locations, 10 x (10 - 1)/2 = 45

---

## Types of Cabling

LANs typically use either copper of fiber-optic cabling.
Copper cabling can include one strand of copper across which an electrical voltage is transimitted, or it can be many strands of copper.
Fiber-optic cabling uses light-emitting diodes (LEDs) and lasers to transmit data across a glass core.

### Coppper Cabling

* **Thicknet**
	* Uses a thick coaxial cable
* **Thinnet**
	* Uses a thin coaxial cable
* **Unshielded twisted pair (UTP)**
	* Uses four pairs of wires in the cable, where each pair is periodically twisted

Of the three copper cabling types, UTP is the most common today, mainly because it is cheaper than the other two and is easier to install and troubleshoot.

Given its advantages, copper cabling, including UTP, has two disadvantages:
* It is susceptible to electromagnetic interference (EMI) and radio frequency interference (RFI).
* Distances of the cable are limted to a short haul (100 meters)

UTP's internal copper cables are either 22-or 24-gauge in diameter. UTP for Ethernet has 100-ohm impedance, so you can't use just any UTP wiring, like the cable that is commonly found with telephones, for example.

Each of the eight wires inside the cable is colored: some solid, some striped.
Two pairs of the wires carry a true voltage, commonly called "tip" (T1-T4), and the other four carry an inverse voltage, commonly called "ring" (R1-R4).
Today, people commonly call these *positive* and *negative* wires, respectively.
A pair consists of a positive and negative wire, such as T1 and R1, T2 and R2, and so on, where each pair is twisted down the length of the cable.

#### UTP Categories

| CAT | DESC                                                |
| --- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| 1   | Used for telephone connections                      |
| 2   | Used for data connections up to 4 Mbps - Token Ring |
| 3   | data up to 10 Mbps - Ethernet 10BaseT               |
| 4   | data up to 16 Mbps - Token Ring                     |
| 5   | data up to 100 Mbps - Ethernet                      |
| 5E  | data up to 1 Gbps   - Ethernet                      |
| 6   | data up to 1 Gbps (24-gauge) - Ethernet             |
| 6A  | 10 Gigabit Ethernet                                 |
| 7   | 10 Gigabit Ethernet                                 |

Each of the endpoints of a UTP cable has an RJ-45 connector, which is a male connector that plugs into a female RJ-45 receptacle.
RJ-45 connector is similar to what you see on a telephone connector (RJ-11), except the RJ-45 is about 50 percent larger in size and holds eight wires instead of four wires.

#### Cabling Devices

With today's implementation of Ethernet over copper, two components make up the connection: an RJ45 connector and CAT5, 5E, 6 or 6A UTP cable.

Two types of implemantations are used for the pinouts of th two sides of the wiring: *straight-through* and *crossover*.
*pinout* refers to the order of the wires and the pins they connect to within the RJ-45 interface.

Two standards define the cabling pinouts: 568B is used for both straight-through cables and one end of a crossover cable.

**568B wiring colors**

| pin | Color                    |
| --- | ------------------------ |
| 1   | White wire/orange stripe |
| 2   | Orange wire              |
| 3   | White wire/green stripe  |
| 4   | Blue wire                |
| 5   | White wire/blue stripe   |
| 6   | Green wire               |
| 7   | White wire/brown stripp  |
| 8   | Brown wire               |

A straight-through Ethernet UTP cable has pin 1 on one end of the cable connected to pin 1 on the other end of the cable, pin 2 to pin 2, and so on.
A straight-through cable is used to connect dissimilar devices together, for example, between computer and a switch or a switch and a router.

**straight-through connections**
![[Pasted image 20250930083842.png]]

A crossover UTP Ethernet cable crosses over two sets of wires: pin1 on one side is connected to pin 3 on the other side, and pin 2 is connected to pin 6.
Crossover cable is used to connect similar devices together such as two computers together, two switches together, or a hub to a switch.

**Crossover connections**

### Fiber

Fiber-optic cabling is typically used to provide very high speeds and to span conections across very large distances.

Two types of fiber are used for data connections: multimode fiber (MMF) and single-mode fiber (SMF).
MMF transmits 850- or 1300-nanomiter (nm) wavelength of light (light in the infrared spectrum, which you can't see with the naked eye). Fiber thickness for MMF is 62.5/125 microns.
The core and cladding diameter (thickness of the actual cabling) is in the 50 to 100 micron range for MMF.
The 850/1300-nm wavelength equate to frequencies in the terahertz (THz) range.
The light is transmitted using an LED.
When transmitting using an LED. When transmitting a signal, the light source is bounced off the inner cladding (shielding) surrounding the fiber.
MMF's relatively large core diameter supports the propagation of multiple lonitudinal modes (that is, different light paths) at a given wavelength; thus the term *mutlimode* is used. These multiple modes cause dispersion (signal spreading), which effectively limits the data speeds carried on the fiber to the hundreads-of-Mbps range.
A good illustration of this process is when you turn on a flashlight close to a wall: as you move away from the wall, the diameter of the light gets larger and larger, showing dispersion.

SMF transmits 1300- or 1500-nm light and uses a laser as the light source. Because lasers provide a higher output than LEDs, SMF can span more than 10 Kilometers in distance and have spees up to 100 Gbps.
Because of SMF's very small core diameter, only a single longitudinal mode is propagated at a given wavelength hence the term *single-mode*.
Since only a single mode is propagated, SMF exhibits less dispersion (that is, signel spreading) than MMF and can therefore support much higher data speeds than MMF (100+ Gbps).

The past decade has seen many advantages in the use and deployment of fiber.
One major enhancement is wavelength division multiplexing (WDM) and dense WDM (DWDM).
WDM allows more than two wavelengths (signals) on the same piece of fiber, increasing the number of connections.
DWDM allows yet more than 200 wavelength can be multiplexed into a light stream on a single piece of fiber.
Obviously, one of the advantages of DWDM is that it provides flexibility and transparency of the protocols and traffic carried across the fiber.

*Cabling* provides the protective outer coating as well as the inner cladding.
The inner cladding is denser to allow the light source to bounce off of it.
In the middle of the cable is the *fiber* itself, which is used to transmit the signal.
The index of refraction (IOR) affects the speed of the light source: it's the ratio of the speed of light in a vacuum to the speed of light in the fiber.
Basically, IOR measures the density of the fiber; the denser the fiber, the slower the light travels through it.

The *loss factor* is used to describe any signal loss in the fiber before the light source gets to the end of the fiber.
*Connector loss* occurs when a connector joins two pieces of fiber: aslight signal loss is expected.
Also, the longer the fiber, the greater the likelihood that the signal strength will decrease by the time it reaches the end of the cable. this is called *attenuation*.

Two other terms describe signal degradation. *Microbending* occurs when a wrinkle in the fiber, typically where the cable is slightly bent, causes a distortion in the light source.
*Macrobending* occurs when the light source leaks from the fiber, typically from a bend in the fiber cable.
To overcome degradation over long distances, *optical amplifers* can be used. These are similar to an Ehternet repeater or hub. A good amplifier, such as an erbium-doped fiber amplifer (EDFA), converts a light source directly to another light source, providing for the best reproduction of the original signal.
Other amplifers convert light to an electrical signal and then back to light, which can cause degradation in the signal quality.

Two main standards are used to describe the transmission of signals across a fiber: SONET (Synchronus Optical Network) and SDH(Synchronus Digital Hierarchy).

SONET is defined by the Exchange Carriers Standards Association (ECSA) and American National Standards Insititude (ANSI) and is typically used in North America.

SDH is an international standard used throughout most of the world (with the exception of North America). Both of these standards define the physical layer framing used to transmit light sources, which also includes overhead for the transmission.
Three types of overhead are experienced:

* **Section overhead (SOH)**
	* Overhead for the link between two devices, such as repeaters
* **Line overhead (LOH)**
	* Overhead for one or more sections connecting network devices, such as hubs
* **Path overhead (POH)**
	* Overhead for one or more lines connecting two devices that assemble and disassemble frames, such as carrier switches or a router's fiber interface

Typically, either a ring or point-to-point topology is used to connect the devices. With carrier metropolitan area networks (MANs), the most common implementation is through the use of rings.
Auto-protection switching (APS) can be used to provide line redundancy: incase of failure on a primary line, a secondary line can automatically be utilized.

**SONET and SDH**

| Common Term | SONET   | SDH    | Connection Rate |
| ----------- | ------- | ------ | --------------- |
| OC-1        | STS-1   | n/a    | 51.84 Mbps      |
| OC-3        | STS-3   | STM-1  | 155.52 Mbps     |
| OC-12       | STS-12  | STM-4  | 622.08 Mbps     |
| OC-48       | STS-48  | STM-16 | 2488.32 Mbps    |
| OC-192      | STS-192 | STM-64 | 9953.28 Mbps    |

The most common types of fiber-optic connectors, and their typical uses:
* **Fiber Channel (FC)**
	* Used by service providers in their patch panels
* **Local Connector (LC)**
	* Used for enterprise equipment and commonly connect to small form-factor pluggable (SFP) modules
* **Standard Connector (SC)**
	* Used for enterprise equipment
* **Straight Tip (ST)**
	* Used for patch panels because of their durability

## Access Methods

You now know that a network uses a topology which is the layout of the network. and you know that some form of media such as cabling connects all hosts on the network.

An access method determines how a host will place data on the wire: does not have to wait its turn or can it just place data on the wire whenever it wants?
The answer is determined by three major access methods: CSMA/CD, CSMA/CA, and token passing.

### CSMA/CD

*Carrier-sense multiple access with collision detection (CSMA/CD)* is one of the most popular access methods in use today.
With CSMA/CD, every host has equal access to the wire and can place data on the wire when the wire is free from traffic.

If a host wants to place data on the wire, it will "sense" the wire and determine whether a signal is already present. If it is, the host will wait to transmit the data; if the wire is free, the host will send the data.

The problem with the process just described is that if two systems "sense" the wire at the same time, they will both send data at the same time if the wire is free.
When two pieces of data are sent on the wire at the same time, they will collide with one another and the data will be destroyed.

If the data is destroyed in transit, the data will need to be retransmitted, Conssequently, after a collision, each host will wait a variable length of time before retransmitting the data (they don't want the data to collide again), thereby preventing a collision the second time.
When a system determines that the data has collided and then retransmits the data, this is known as *collision detection*

To summarize, with CSMA/CD, before a host sends data on the network, it will "sense (CS)" the wire to ensure that it is free of traffic.
Multiple systems have equal access to the wire (MA), and if there is a collision, a host will detect that collision (CD) and retransmit the data.

### CSMA/CA

*Carrier-sense multiple access with collision avoidance (CSMA/CA)* is not as popular as CSMA/CD, and for good reason.
With CSMA/CA, before a host sends data on the wire, it will "sense" the wire to see if it is free of signals.
If the wire is free, the host will try to "avoid" a collision by sending a signal out, letting all others know they should wait before sending data.

This helps prevent collisions from occuring, but it involves sending more data out on the wire.

### Token Passing

With both CSMA/CD and CSMA/CA, the possibility of collisions is always there, and the more hosts that are placed on the wire, the greater the chances of collisions, because you have more systems "waiting" for the wire to become free so that they can send their data.

Token passing takes a totally different approach in determining how a system can place data on the wire.
With token passing, an empty packet is running around on the wire (the "token"). To place data on the wire, the system needs to wait for the token; once the system has the the token and it is free of data, the system can place data on the wire.
Since there is only one token and a host needs to have the token to "talk", it is impossible to have collisions in a token-passing environment.

For example, if Workstation 1 wants to send data on the wire, the workstation would wait for the token, which is circling the network millions of times per seconds.
Once the token reaches workstation 1, the workstation takes the token off the network, fills it with the data, marks the token as being used so that no other systems try to fill the token with the data, and then places the token back on the wire heading for the destination host.

All systems will look at the data, but they will not process it, since it is not destined for them.
However, the system that is the intended destination will read the data and send the token back to the sender as a confirmation. Once the token has reached the original sender, the token is unflagged as being used and released as an empty token onto the network.

## Network Architectures

### Ethernet

Many physical layer standards define the physical properties of an Ethernet implementation.
One of the most common is IEEE 802.3 10Mb.
The most common copper cabling for Ethernet is UTP.

**Some of the 10-Mbps standards**

| Ethernet Type | Distance Limitation | Cable Type                              | Interface Type | Physical Topology | Logical Topology |
| ------------- | ------------------- | --------------------------------------- | -------------- | ----------------- | ---------------- |
| 10Base5       | 500m                | Thick coaxial cable 50 ohm (thicknet)   | AUI            | Bus               | Bus              |
| 10Base2       | 185m                | Thin coaxial cable (thinnet)            | BNC            | Bus               | Bus              |
| 10BaseT       | 100m                | UTP cabling (CAT 3, 4, 5, 5E, 6 and 6A) | RJ-45          | Star (hub)        | Bus              |

Ethernet supports a bus topology (physical or logical).
In a bus topology, every device is connected to the same piece of wire and all devices see every frame.

For example, 10Base5 uses one long, thick piece of coaxial cable. NICs tap into this wire using a vampire tap.
With 10Base2, the devices are connected together by many pieces of wire using BNC connectors, commonly called T-taps: one end of T-tab connects to the NIC and the other two connect to the Ehternet cables that are part of the bus. Both endpoints of the cable must be terminated with a terminator cap.
With 10BaseT, all devices are connected to a hub, where the hub provides a logical bus topology.

All of these 10 Mbps Ethernet solutions support only half-duplex: they can send or receive, but they cannot do both simultaneously.

### Fast Ethernet

Ethernet 10Base2 and 10Base5 haven't been used in years because of the difficulty in troubleshooting network problems based on the cabling they use.
And 10BaseT networks have been supplnated by higher speed Ethernet solutions, such as Fast Ethernet and Gigabit Ethernet.

All Ethernet standard uses CSMA/CD as the access method with Fast Ethernet running at 100 Mbps (while ther older Ethernet ran at 10 Mbps).
The older 10 Mbps Ethernet is half-duplex, meaning you can send and receive data, but only one direction at a time.
Fast Ethernet is full duplex.

**different implementations of Fast Ethernet**

| Ethernet type | Distance Limitation                     | Cable Type                                    | Cabling | Physical topology | Logical topology |
| ------------- | --------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- | ------- | ----------------- | ---------------- |
| 100BaseTX     | 100m                                    | UTP CAT 5, 5E, 6, 6A                          | RJ-45   | Star              | Bus              |
| 100BaseFX     | 400m (half duplex), 2000m (full duplex) | MMF 62.5/125 micron with SC and ST connectors | RJ-45   | Star              | Bus              |
| 100BaseT4     | 100m                                    | UTP CAT 3, 4, 5                               | RJ-45   | Star              |                  |

Fast Ethernet supports both half and full duplex connections.
With Full-duplex connections, a device can send and receive simultaneously but requires a point-to-point connection that dosen't involve a hub.

### Gigabit Ethernet

Gigabit Ethernet is defined in IEEE 802.3z.
To achieve 1-Gbps speeds, IEEE adopted the ANSI X3T11 Fiber Channel standard for the physical layer implemantion.
The physical layer is different from Ethernet and Fast Ethernet in that uses an 8B/10B encoding scheme to code the physical layer information when transmitting it across the wire.

The IEEE standard has been around for about a decade.
Gigabit Ethernet connections are commonly used for uplink connections (switch-to-switch) and server applications.

**different implemenations of Gigabit Ethernet**

| Ethernet Type | Distance Limitation | Cable Type                |
| ------------- | ------------------- | ------------------------- |
| 1000BaseCX    | 25m                 | STP copper                |
| 1000BaseLX    | 3-10km              | SMF                       |
| 1000BaseSX    | 275m                | MMF                       |
| 1000BaseT     | 100m                | CAT 5E, CAT 6 UTP (RJ-45) |
| 1000BaseZX    | 100m                | SMF                       |

### 10-Gigabit Ethernet

Standard for 10-Gigabit Ethernet (10,000 Mbps) have been developed that use fiber-optic cabling or UTP:

* **10GBaseSR**
	* "short-range" MMF cable
	* max distance of 400m
* **10GBaseLR**
	* "long-range" SMF cable
	* max distance of 10km
* **10GbaseER**
	* "extra-long-range" SMF cable
	* max distance of 40km
* **10BaseT**
	* CAT 6a UTP cabling
	* max distance of 100m

### Serial, Optical, and Other Architectures

#### Serial

Many network technologies deliver data in serial fashion, which means they deliver the data in a stream of bits, on after the other (versus a parallel technology that delivers multiple bits at one time).
Serial connections are typically used with WAN connections, enabling your network to connect to other networks through a provider.

#### Optical

There are also special WAN versions of 10-Gigabit Ethernet that use fiber-optic cabling to connect to a SONET network

* **10GBaseSW**
	* short range MMF
	* 100m
* **10GBaseLW**
	* long range SMF
	* 10km
* **10GBaseEW**
	* extended-range SMF
	* 40km

#### Concepts of PoE

PoE is known as the IEEE 802.af standard and is a method of delivering power to devices using the Ethernet port.
PoE has improved over time with what is known as PoE+, which is the 802.at standard.

The benefit of PoE is that a device that supports PoE dose not need a separate power cable to power the device; it can recive the power through the Ethernet port from the switch it is plugged into.

Common examples of devices that can receive PoE are IP phones, wireless access points, and network cameras.

For PoE to work, the switch must have PoE-supported ports that the device would connect to. The device would also have to be a PoE-enabled device that can receive a PoE connection.

### GBICs

A *gigabit interface converter (GBIC)* is an input/output (I/O) device that is plugged into a Gigabit Ethernet interface (and 10-Gbps connectors) and provides various interface connector types.

The advantage of GBICs is that when you purchase a device that supports GBICs, your device comes with a Gigabit Ethernet port and you buy the appropriate GBIC interface connector based on the cabling you'll be using.

This means that if you ever need to change your cable requirements, you need to swap only your current GBIC for one that matches your new cabling needs.

Most GBICs are *hot-swappable*, but you should always check the device manufacturer's instructions before inserting or removing them.

GBIC connectors are common in company networks, especially in data centers and for uplink connections in campus networks.
The original standard, 802.3ak, in 2004 deinfed 10 Gbps over twin-axial cable, commonly called InfiniBand. 10-Gigabit Ethernet requires full-duplex connections.

There are many different standards for 10Gbps, and they primarlly differ in the connectors, cabling, and how information is transmitted.
The standard today is 802.3-2012, which accommodates all the 10 Gbps, 1 Gbps, and previous Ethernet standards.

Note that GBIC ports and connectors have been superseded by *Small Form-factor Pluggable (SPF)* ports.

### Troubleshooting Interface and Cable Issues

When you're connecting devices to the network, a number of common issues may arise that deal with network connectivity and communication problems.

#### Collisioins

With Ethernet networks, it is possible for two systems to send data on the network at the same time and for that data to collide.
This was common issue when network hubs were used, because the hub would send the data to every port on the hub.

Using network switches will help prevent collisions, because the switch sends the data only to the port that the desination system is connected to. Also, if the line is busy with traffic, the switch can store the packet until the line is free of a signal.

#### Errors

Network or packet errors can occur if there is a faulty network card or faulty cables.
If corrupt packets are received, the sending system will need to transmit the data, which in the end uses up more bandwidth.

#### Mismatch Duplex

The duplex setting on either end of the communication should match. or network errors will occur.

#### Speed

The speed of the network interface must match the speed at the other end of the communication.
For example, the speed should be set to either 100Mbps or 1000Mbps, whichever matches the speed of the device you are connecting to.
Network card and ports on your device include an autodetect setting that will automatically detect the speed that is being used.

## Virtualization Fundamentals

The benefit of virtualization technology is that, overall, companies use minimal resources such as memory, processor, and disk space on the actual physical servers they pay for.

For example, suppose your company wants to have an e-mail server, so you spend thousands of dollars on this server, but once the e-mail server is installed and running, you are only using 30 percent of the RAM you purchased and 20 percent of the processing power.
Then the company wants a database server and purchases a new physical server for you to install the database software on.
This doesn't make sense, though, because the original system you purchased is underutilzed.

In this day and age, you can use virtualization software that enables you to run both the e-mail server and database server on the same physical server.

#### Hypervisors

Virtualization of systems is provided by the *hypervisor*. Also known as the virtual machine monitor (VMM), the hypervisor is the software component that enables you to create and run virtual machines on the system.

There are two different types of hypervisors:
* **Type I**
	* This hypervisor type is software that runs directly on top of the hardware, which then has the host operating system running as a parent virtual machine.
	* This enables the hypervisor to control access to the hardware from the host and guest systems.
	* These are also known as bare-metal hypervisors, because they run directly on top of the hardware.
* **Type II**
	* This hypervisor involvs having the OS installe on top of the hardware, and then installing virtualiation software that will create VMs.

#### Virtual Networking Components

With virtualization software, you can virtualize a number of different types of networking components.

* **Virtual Switches**
* Virtual Routers
* Virtual firewall
* Virtual NICs
* Software-defined networking (SDN)
* Virtual desktops
* Virtual servers

## Chapter Review

* Introduction to networks
* network topologies

A network connects concepts across a distance to enable the sharing of resources such as applications and data, printers, and network storage.
Characteristics to consider when implementing and maintaing a network design include cost, security, speed, topology, scalability, reliability, and availability.

Components common to a network include cabling, computers, switches, routers, firewalls, wireless access points, and others.

Networks come in all shapes and sizes: central office, branch office, SOHO, and movile users.

Network topologies describe how network components are physically cabled and logically how network components communicate with each other.
Topology types include point-to-point, star, bus, and ring.
Meshing describes how components are interconnected. In a fully meshed topology, every component has direct communication with every other component. In a partially meshed topology, not every component has direct communicate with an intermediate component to get information to the actual destination.

## Quick Review

### Introdution to Networks

* A network includes all of the hardware and software components used to connect computers across a distance to provide easy access to information and to increase productivity. To build a network, you need computers, networking devices, and media (cable or wireless connections)
* A SOHO (Small Office/Home Office) refers to small company office or home office where only a few people work. A branch office involves a small group of users connected in a small area (LAN) that is geographically separated from a corporate office. Mobile users connect to a network from any remote location. A central or corporate office is the location of critical services and applications accessed by central office, branch office, SOHO, and mobile users.

### Common Network Services and Devices

* Know the common network services: DHCP, DNS server etc
* A network-based firewall is used to control what traffic is allowed to enter or leave the network. The firewall traffic by analyzing the header of the packet and deciding if it is allowed in, based on the firewall rules.
* An access point is a device that connects to the network and enables wireless clients to connect to and gain access to the network.

### Network Topologies

* Point-to-Point
	* uses a single connection between two devices and is typically used in WAN environments.
* Star
	* A central device makes many point-to-point connections to other devices.
	* 10BaseT hub
* bus
	* uses a single connection between all devices
	* 10Base5
* ring
	* connects one device to the next, where the last device is connected to the first
	* FDDI

* A physical topology defines how the computing devices are physically cabled together.
* A logical topology describes the method by which devices communicate across a physical topology.

* Meshing genericaly describes how devices are connected.
	* Partially meshed
	* Fully meshed

### Types of Cabling

* Copper cabling with Ethernet commonly uses UTP, a four-pair wire.
* UTP cabling however, can span only short distances and is suspceptible to EMI and RFI.
* UTP cables use RJ-45 connectors.

* Straight-through UTP cables are used to connect dissimilar devices.
	* computer to a switch
	* switch to a router
* Crossover UTP cables are used to connect similar devices
	* computer to a computer
	* switch to a switch
	* computer to a router

* Fiber-optic cabling, a glass core carries pluses of light and is immune to electrical interference.
	* typicall used as a backbone between buildings
	* It can also used at the workstation.
	* MMF (for short distances, Mutli Mode), SMF (longer distances, Single Mode)


### Access Methods

* CSMA/CD
	* used by all Ethernet archiectures and involves a system sensing the wire before sending data on the wire.
* Token passing
	* The system needs to wait for the token before it can pass a token on the wire
	* once the system has the token and it is free of data, the system can place data on the wire.
	* Systems need the token before they can send data.
